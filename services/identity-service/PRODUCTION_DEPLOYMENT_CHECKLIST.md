## üîç Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Check JWT key configuration
kubectl logs -n focushive deployment/identity-service | grep "JWT"

# Verify OAuth2 client configuration
kubectl exec -n focushive deployment/identity-service -- curl localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database connectivity
kubectl exec -n focushive deployment/identity-service -- nc -zv $DB_HOST 5432

# Review connection pool metrics
curl -s http://identity-service.focushive.com/actuator/prometheus | grep hikaricp
```

#### Redis Connection Issues
```bash
# Test Redis connectivity
kubectl exec -n focushive deployment/identity-service -- redis-cli -h $REDIS_HOST -p 6380 ping

# Check Redis cluster status
kubectl exec -n focushive deployment/identity-service -- redis-cli -c -h $REDIS_HOST -p 6380 cluster info
```

This comprehensive checklist ensures that the Identity Service is deployed with enterprise-grade security, performance, and reliability standards.
