# OpenID Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
The notification service was failing to start because it was trying to fetch OpenID configuration from the identity service at `/.well-known/openid-configuration/identity` which was returning a 500 error.

## Root Cause
The `OpenIdConnectDiscoveryController` in the identity service only handled:
- `/.well-known/openid_configuration` (with underscore)

But did not handle:
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration` (with hyphen)
- `/.well-known/openid-configuration/identity` (with identity suffix)

## Solution Implemented

### Code Change
Modified `/services/identity-service/src/main/java/com/focushive/identity/controller/OpenIdConnectDiscoveryController.java`:

```java
@GetMapping(value = {
    "/.well-known/openid_configuration",  // Standard with underscore
    "/.well-known/openid-configuration",  // Variant with hyphen
    "/.well-known/openid-configuration/identity"  // With identity suffix for notification service
}, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public ResponseEntity<Map<String, Object>> openIdConfiguration() {
    // ... existing implementation
}
```

### Files Modified
- `src/main/java/com/focushive/identity/controller/OpenIdConnectDiscoveryController.java` - Added multiple endpoint paths

### Build Status
- ✅ Code compiled successfully
- ✅ JAR built successfully (`./gradlew bootJar`)

## Current Status

### Completed
- ✅ RSA token generation issue fixed (from previous context)
- ✅ OpenID configuration endpoint updated to handle multiple paths
- ✅ Code changes tested and built successfully

### Pending
- ⚠️ Deploy updated JAR to Docker environment
- ⚠️ Verify notification service can start with the fix
- ⚠️ Remove test endpoints created for debugging

## Next Steps

### To Deploy the Fix
1. **Option 1: Rebuild Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t focushive-identity-service:latest .
   docker-compose restart focushive-identity-service-app
   ```

2. **Option 2: Update Running Container** (temporary)
   ```bash
   docker cp build/libs/identity-service.jar focushive-identity-service-app:/app/
   docker restart focushive-identity-service-app
   ```

### To Verify the Fix
```bash
# Test the OpenID configuration endpoints
curl http://localhost:8081/.well-known/openid-configuration
curl http://localhost:8081/.well-known/openid-configuration/identity

# Check if notification service starts successfully
docker-compose up notification-service
```

## Key Learnings

1. **OpenID Connect Path Variations**: Different clients may expect different path conventions:
   - Some use underscore: `openid_configuration`
   - Some use hyphen: `openid-configuration`
   - Some add suffixes: `/identity`

2. **Spring Boot Mapping**: Spring Boot's `@GetMapping` can accept multiple paths in an array, making it easy to support multiple endpoint variations.

3. **Service Dependencies**: The notification service depends on the identity service being properly configured and accessible for OAuth2/OpenID Connect discovery.
