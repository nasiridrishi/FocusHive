# Buddy Service Health Endpoint Fix

## Issue
The Buddy Service health check endpoint was returning HTTP 500 error with message:
```
NoResourceFoundException: No static resource actuator/health
```

## Root Cause
The Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are configured to run on a **separate management port (8088)** while the main application runs on port 8087. When requests to `/actuator/*` were made on port 8087, Spring was treating them as static resource requests, leading to the NoResourceFoundException.

## Solution

### Implementation
1. **Created ActuatorRedirectController**: A REST controller that handles `/actuator/**` requests on port 8087 and returns informative JSON responses with proper guidance
2. **Updated ActuatorMvcConfig**: Configured MVC to not treat actuator paths as static resources
3. **Modified SimpleSecurityConfig**: Allowed access to `/actuator/**` paths on port 8087 to return the guidance messages

### Port Configuration
- **Application Port**: 8087 (main application endpoints)
- **Management Port**: 8088 (actuator/management endpoints)

### Actuator Endpoints Access
All actuator endpoints must be accessed on port **8088**:

| Endpoint | URL | Status | Authentication |
|----------|-----|--------|----------------|
| Health | http://localhost:8088/actuator/health | ✅ Working | Not required |
| Liveness | http://localhost:8088/actuator/health/liveness | ✅ Working | Not required |
| Readiness | http://localhost:8088/actuator/health/readiness | ✅ Working | Not required |
| Info | http://localhost:8088/actuator/info | ✅ Working | Required |
| Metrics | http://localhost:8088/actuator/metrics | ✅ Working | Required |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:8088/actuator/prometheus | ✅ Working | Required |

### Configuration Files Updated

1. **SimpleSecurityConfig.java**
   - Added explicit permission for actuator endpoints
   - Configured to allow health endpoints without authentication

2. **application-docker.properties**
   - Added `management.endpoints.web.base-path=/actuator`
   - Set `management.endpoint.health.show-details=always`
   - Configured `management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled=true`

### Docker Health Check Configuration
The Docker health check in `docker-compose.yml` should use port 8087 for the custom health endpoint:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:8087/api/v1/health"]
```

Or alternatively, use the actuator endpoint on port 8088:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:8088/actuator/health/liveness"]
```

### Testing

Test actuator health endpoint:
```bash
# Main health endpoint (returns overall status)
curl http://localhost:8088/actuator/health

# Liveness probe (for Kubernetes/Docker)
curl http://localhost:8088/actuator/health/liveness

# Readiness probe (for Kubernetes/Docker)
curl http://localhost:8088/actuator/health/readiness
```

Test custom application health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8087/api/v1/health
```

## Health Status Details

The health endpoint returns status DOWN (503) when any component is unhealthy. Current status:
- **Database**: UP ✅
- **Redis**: UP ✅
- **DiskSpace**: UP ✅
- **Identity Service**: DOWN ❌ (expected as it's not running)

Overall status is DOWN due to the identity service dependency, but this is expected behavior in the current environment.

## Key Learnings

1. **Management Port Separation**: Spring Boot can configure actuator endpoints on a separate port for security
2. **Security Configuration**: Actuator endpoints need explicit security configuration to be accessible
3. **Docker Health Checks**: Can use either custom application endpoints or actuator endpoints for health checks
4. **Port Documentation**: Always document which ports serve which endpoints to avoid confusion
