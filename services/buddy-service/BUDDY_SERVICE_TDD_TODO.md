## Notes
- Each task MUST start with writing failing tests (RED phase)
- Only write minimal code to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
- Always refactor after tests pass (REFACTOR phase)
- Run `./gradlew test --continuous` during development
- Commit after each GREEN phase
- Update this document as tasks are completed
- Mark tasks with appropriate status emoji
