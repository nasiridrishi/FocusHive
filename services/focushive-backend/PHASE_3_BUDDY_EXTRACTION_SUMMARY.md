# Phase 3: Buddy Service Extraction - Progress Summary

## Status: ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

## Objective
Extract the Buddy Service from the FocusHive backend monolith into a standalone microservice.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Pre-Task Analysis ✅
- Verified standalone buddy service (135 Java files) is more complete than backend module (26 files)
- Confirmed standalone service architecture is more mature with full package structure

### 2. Build Configuration ✅
- Fixed compilation errors:
  - Added Jakarta annotations dependency (replacing javax.annotation)
  - Fixed CacheMetricsRegistrar issue for Spring Boot 3.x
  - Fixed RedisCacheManager builder syntax
- Added H2 database dependency for test profile
- Successfully built buddy-service.jar (87MB)

### 3. Test Profile Configuration ✅
- Created application-test.properties with:
  - H2 in-memory database for testing
  - Disabled Flyway migrations for test profile
  - Disabled Redis for test environment
  - Bean definition overriding enabled
  - Cache disabled for testing

### 4. Service Startup Issues ⚠️
- Service encounters startup issues with test profile
- May need additional configuration for successful startup
- Port 8087 is configured but service not fully operational

## Key Files Changed

### Created:
- `/services/buddy-service/src/main/resources/application-test.properties` - Test profile configuration

### Modified:
- `/services/buddy-service/build.gradle.kts` - Added H2 and Jakarta dependencies
- `/services/buddy-service/src/main/java/com/focushive/buddy/config/CacheMetricsConfig.java` - Fixed Spring Boot 3.x compatibility
- `/services/buddy-service/src/main/java/com/focushive/buddy/config/CacheConfig.java` - Fixed RedisCacheManager builder
- `/services/buddy-service/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Added bean overriding

## Known Issues

1. **Bean Definition Conflicts**: Multiple beans with same names need resolution
2. **Redis Dependencies**: Service expects Redis even with cache disabled
3. **Flyway Migrations**: Migration scripts may need adjustment for H2 database
4. **Service Startup**: Service not fully starting on port 8087

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
- Debug and fix remaining startup issues
- Create proper Feign client for backend integration
- Archive backend buddy module once service is operational

### Future:
- Phase 4: Final Integration Testing (when all services are running)
- Phase 5: Cleanup & Optimization

## Architecture Progress

The buddy service:
- Has been successfully built as a standalone JAR
- Is configured to run on port 8087
- Has test profile configuration for development
- Needs additional configuration tuning for full operation

## Success Criteria Progress

✅ Standalone service builds successfully
⚠️ Service startup needs resolution
❌ Feign client not yet created for backend integration
❌ Backend configuration not yet updated
❌ Old module not yet archived

The buddy service extraction is partially complete. The service builds successfully but requires additional configuration work to run properly as a standalone microservice.
