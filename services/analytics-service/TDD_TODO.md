## Notes

1. **NO TASK** can begin implementation without failing tests first
2. Each task must be reviewed by code-reviewer for TDD compliance
3. Coverage reports must be generated after each phase
4. Any deviation from TDD must be documented and justified
5. Regular TDD retrospectives should be held

**Remember: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor - This is the way!**
