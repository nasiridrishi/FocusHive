# Data Integrity E2E Tests for FocusHive (UOL-320)

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite validates FocusHive's data integrity across all critical dimensions, ensuring that the application maintains consistent, accurate, and reliable data under all conditions including concurrent access, system failures, and real-time synchronization.

## Test Categories

### 1. Transaction Consistency and ACID Compliance

Tests the fundamental ACID properties of database transactions:

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or all fail
- **Consistency**: Business rules and constraints are enforced
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Committed transactions persist through system failures

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Transaction rollback on failure
- Distributed transactions using Two-Phase Commit
- Saga pattern implementation for long-running processes
- System restart durability validation

### 2. Concurrent Modification Handling

Validates how the system handles simultaneous data modifications:

- **Optimistic Locking**: Version conflict detection and resolution
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Exclusive access and deadlock prevention
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Atomic operations in critical sections
- **Version Control Conflicts**: Merge conflict resolution for collaborative features

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- 50+ concurrent users modifying same resources
- Version conflict resolution with last-writer-wins
- Deadlock detection and automatic resolution
- Collaborative editing with operational transforms

### 3. Data Validation Rules and Business Logic

Ensures all input validation and business rules are properly enforced:

- **Input Sanitization**: XSS, SQL injection, and path traversal prevention
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Domain-specific constraints and limits
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key relationships and cascade operations
- **Unique Constraint Validation**: Prevention of duplicate entries

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Malicious input sanitization (script tags, SQL commands)
- Business rule violations (user limits, timer constraints)
- Orphaned record prevention
- Data format and type validation

### 4. Cross-Service Data Consistency

Validates data consistency across FocusHive's microservices:

- **Event Sourcing Integrity**: Immutable event streams and replay consistency
- **CQRS Pattern Validation**: Command/query separation and read model consistency
- **Service-to-Service Sync**: Data propagation between microservices
- **Message Queue Reliability**: Delivery guarantees and ordering
- **Eventual Consistency**: Convergence within defined time windows

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Event replay produces consistent state
- Read models sync within 30 seconds
- Service communication with 99%+ delivery rate
- Message ordering preservation

### 5. Cache Coherence and Consistency

Ensures cache layers maintain data accuracy:

- **Cache Invalidation Accuracy**: Correct cache clearing on data changes
- **Write-Through Cache Validation**: Synchronous cache and database updates
- **Write-Behind Cache Consistency**: Eventual consistency with batched writes
- **Distributed Cache Sync**: Multi-node cache coordination
- **Cache Expiry Handling**: TTL accuracy and background cleanup

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Cache invalidation within 5 seconds of data changes
- Write-through consistency verification
- Distributed cache node synchronization
- Proper TTL enforcement and cleanup

### 6. Database Integrity and Constraints

Validates database-level integrity mechanisms:

- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Referential integrity enforcement
- **Cascade Operations**: DELETE, UPDATE, SET NULL, and RESTRICT behaviors
- **Database Trigger Execution**: Automated business logic execution
- **Stored Procedure Validation**: Complex operation reliability
- **Index Consistency**: Performance optimization integrity

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Constraint violation prevention
- Cascade delete propagation verification
- Trigger execution for audit logging
- Index maintenance and query optimization

### 7. Data Migration Safety and Version Control

Ensures safe schema changes and data transformations:

- **Schema Version Control**: Migration ordering and rollback capability
- **Backward Compatibility**: Old client support during transitions
- **Data Transformation Accuracy**: Loss-free data format changes
- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Service availability during upgrades
- **Migration Rollback**: Safe reversion to previous versions

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Multi-step migration with rollback testing
- Backward compatibility with older API versions
- Data transformation accuracy verification
- Service availability >99.9% during migrations

### 8. Audit Trail Integrity and Compliance

Validates comprehensive activity logging and compliance:

- **Change Tracking Accuracy**: Field-level change detection
- **User Action Logging**: Complete activity audit trails
