# Login Tests Status Report

## Summary
Created comprehensive login test suite with 10 test cases covering critical authentication paths.
Currently 6/10 tests passing reliably.

## Test Cases Status

### ✅ Passing (6 tests)
- LOGIN-002: Invalid email format rejection
- LOGIN-003: Wrong password handling
- LOGIN-004: Non-existent user security
- LOGIN-005: Account lockout after failed attempts
- LOGIN-007: XSS prevention in login fields
- LOGIN-010: Concurrent login handling

### ❌ Failing (4 tests)
- LOGIN-001: Valid credentials login (401 - test user not in backend)
- LOGIN-006: Remember me functionality (depends on successful login)
- LOGIN-008: JWT authentication (depends on successful login)
- LOGIN-009: Session persistence (depends on successful login)

## Key Findings

### Authentication Flow
1. App uses JWT tokens stored in:
   - `sessionStorage`: Access token (focushive_access_token)
   - `localStorage`: Refresh token (focushive_refresh_token)
   - No cookies used for authentication

2. Login endpoint: `/api/v1/auth/login`
   - Success: 200 status with JWT tokens
   - Failure: 401 for invalid credentials

3. After successful login:
   - Redirects to `/dashboard`
   - Stores tokens in browser storage
   - Access token auto-restored on refresh using refresh token

### Test User Issue
- Test user `e2e.auth@focushive.test` with password `TestPassword123!` needs to exist in backend
- Registration flow in tests creates user but may not persist across test runs
- Backend might reset between test runs causing authentication failures

## Recommendations

1. **Backend Test Data**: Ensure test users are seeded in backend before running tests
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should create its own user or use pre-seeded test accounts
3. **Mock Authentication**: Consider mocking auth endpoints for more reliable tests
4. **Environment Setup**: Create dedicated test environment with persistent test data

## Test Implementation Notes

### Page Object Pattern
- Implemented `LoginPage` class with reusable methods
- Clean separation of concerns between test logic and page interactions

### Playwright MCP Integration
- Successfully used Playwright MCP tools for browser automation
- Real browser testing provides accurate representation of user behavior

### Error Handling
- Tests gracefully handle missing UI elements
- Flexible assertions to accommodate varying app states

## Next Steps

1. Coordinate with backend team to seed test users
2. Implement test data setup/teardown scripts
3. Add retry logic for flaky authentication tests
4. Consider parallel test execution once authentication is stable
