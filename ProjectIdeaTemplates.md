### Project Idea 2: Designing an Emotion-Aware Adaptive Email and Task Manager to Reduce Workplace Stress

**What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?**  
Workplace stress is a significant challenge, especially when employees are overwhelmed with emails, deadlines, and task lists. Traditional email and task management tools can increase stress by bombarding users with complex interfaces, too many notifications, and no support for mental well-being. This project aims to develop an emotion-aware email and task management interface that detects user stress levels and adapts the experience to provide a calmer, more supportive environment.

**What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?**

**What would the final product or final outcome look like?**  
The final product will be a functional prototype of an email and task manager app that:  
- Detects stress levels via facial expressions, typing speed, or voice tone.  
- Dynamically adapts features, such as:  
- Simplified UI to highlight high priority emails or tasks.  
- Reduction of notifications during stress peaks.  
- Stress-relief options like short guided breathing exercises or calming themes.  

**What would a prototype look like?**  
The prototype would demonstrate a basic interface for email and task management with:  
- Emotion detection integrated via APIs.  
- A responsive interface demonstrating adaptive UI changes based on simulated user stress.  
- A sample adaptive feature (e.g. hiding non-urgent tasks or emails).  
- Interactive elements that modify information display (e.g. minimising clutter, restructuring task lists).  
- At least one stress-relief feature, such as a pop-up suggestion to take a break or a calming visual theme. Subtle real-time feedback mechanisms, such as colour shifts, progressive disclosure of tasks, or motivational messages.

**What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?**  
- Emotion detection APIs (e.g., facial recognition or sentiment analysis tools).  
- Adaptive UI design (dynamic interface changes).  
- Usability testing focused on stress reduction.

**How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of the project)? What criteria are important?**  
- Interaction quality: Effectiveness of adaptive UI in enhancing user experience.  
- Technical Implementation: Integration of emotion detection and adaptive interface elements.  
- Usability: Ease of use, accessibility and effectiveness of stress-reducing features.  
- Relevance: Ability to address common workplace stressors like email overload and task prioritisation.  
- Testing and User feedback Integration: Evidence of user testing and iteration based on feedback.  

**For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?**  
A prototype that integrates emotion detection and demonstrates one adaptive feature.  
Limited usability testing, with a basic concept of how the tool reduces stress.

**For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 - 2:1) student project look like?**  
A prototype with multiple adaptive features (e.g., simplified UI and stress-relief options).  
- Evidence of usability testing, including participant feedback on stress-reduction effectiveness.  

**For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?**  
- A polished prototype with seamless emotion detection, multiple adaptive features, and innovative stress-reduction elements (e.g., personalised relaxation techniques).  
- Extensive user testing and strong documentation of design iterations.  
- Clear evidence of the app's potential real-world impact in reducing workplace stress. A clear demonstration of how interaction design principles improve workplace well-being.

## CM3035 Advanced Web Design

### Project Idea 1: Identity and profile management API

**What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?**  
We have different names, usernames and ways of presenting ourselves in different contexts. Devise a Web API to manage them securely and flexibly.

**What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?**  
Many people present themselves differently in different contexts. Some have legal names that differ from the names they use in their daily lives, or use middle names.  

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation  

**What would the final product or final outcome look like?**  
A requirement specification (based on literature survey and, optionally user consultation) for an identity management system. An implementation that at least covers names and, optionally, adds gender identities, online profile data and other relevant information.

**What would a prototype look like?**  
A completed API, a backend datastore and a UI. Some form of authentication and user management will be necessary.

**What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?**  
Web API, Data/web security, data modelling, social computing  

**What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?**  
A study of the requirements for such a system and a secure implementation  

**How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of the project)? What criteria are important?**  
- A good understanding of the user needs  
- A well-thought-through API  

**For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?**  
A simple API.  

**For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 - 2:1) student project look like?**  
An API that supports a good variety of use contexts. An example web front end works and is user-friendly and accessible.

**For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?**  
A strong requirements document that shows research and imagination. Solid security and privacy policies. A requirements document containing a high level of detail about the data model goes beyond the simplest use cases. The API is robust and would be widely applicable. A web front end clearly demonstrates multiple use cases for the API.

## CM3065 Intelligent Signal Processing

### Project Idea 1: Gamified Smart Environment to Promote Mental and Physical well-being in our Everyday Life

**What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?**  
This project aims to develop a creative robotic or Internet-of-things (IoT) based solution to tackle mental health well-being and promote physical activities for vulnerable individuals in the age of a hyper-connected world.

**What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?**  
In the era of remote working and digital streaming services, mental health and obesity-related health concerns are on the rise in developed and developing countries.

**What would the final product or final outcome look like?**  
A bespoke gamified IoT-based end product which creatively engages mind and physical activities throughout the day. The end product would have a backend server application to manage and track users' activities over a period which can then be used to learn from their interactions to potentially change the level of difficulties of games or the needs of the users over time using machine learning/AI techniques.

**What would a prototype look like?**  
A bespoke gamified IoT-based end product could have collections of microcontrollers (i.e., ESP32-CAM) or/and make use of existing IoT devices in the house like...

**For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?**  
Pass projects should be able to demonstrate a suitable prototype which encourages individuals to take part in daily mental and physical gaming challenges.

**For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 - 2:1) student project look like?**  
Merit projects should be able to engage users in their gameplay with an appropriate level of incentives and gaming experience created using embedded IoT devices or robots.

**For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?**  
An outstanding project not only engages users to take part in IoT-based gameplay to improve mental and physical activities but also adapts to the changing needs of the users over time.
