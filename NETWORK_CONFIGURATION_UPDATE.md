# Docker Network Configuration Update

## Problem Solved
**UnknownHostException between FocusHive services** - Services couldn't communicate with each other because they were isolated on separate Docker networks.

## Root Cause
Each service was configured with its own isolated network:
- Identity Service: `focushive-identity-network`
- Notification Service: `focushive-notification-network` 
- Buddy Service: `focushive_buddy_service_network`
- Backend Service: `focushive-backend-network`

This isolation caused `UnknownHostException` when services tried to call each other (e.g., Identity Service → Notification Service).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Shared Network
```bash
docker network create focushive-shared-network
```

### 2. Updated All Docker Compose Files
All services now use the shared network: `focushive-shared-network`

#### Files Updated:
- `/services/identity-service/docker-compose.yml`
- `/services/notification-service/docker-compose.yml`  
- `/services/buddy-service/docker-compose.yml`
- `/services/focushive-backend/docker-compose.yml`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Network References**: All `networks` sections now reference `focushive-shared-network`
2. **Network Definition**: All services define the network as external:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     # Shared network for all FocusHive services to communicate with each other
     # Prevents network isolation issues that cause UnknownHostException between services
     focushive-shared-network:
       external: true
       name: focushive-shared-network
   ```

3. **Service URLs**: Updated focushive-backend service URLs to use container names:
   ```yaml
   IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL: http://focushive-identity-service-app:8081
   NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL: http://focushive-notification-service-app:8083
   BUDDY_SERVICE_URL: http://focushive_buddy_service_app:8087
   ```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Immediate Fix**
- Services can now communicate with each other
- No more `UnknownHostException` errors
- Email notifications work during user registration

### ✅ **Permanent Solution**
- When containers restart/recreate, they automatically join the shared network
- No manual network connection required
- Consistent across all environments

### ✅ **Maintainable**
- Clear comments explain why shared network is used
- Easy to understand for future developers
- Prevents regression of network isolation issues

## Container Communication Map

```
focushive-shared-network
├── focushive-identity-service-app:8081
├── focushive-notification-service-app:8083  
├── focushive_buddy_service_app:8087
└── focushive_backend_main:8080
```

## Verification
All services can now resolve each other by container name:
```bash
# Test from identity service to notification service
docker exec focushive-identity-service-app ping focushive-notification-service-app
docker exec focushive-identity-service-app curl http://focushive-notification-service-app:8083/actuator/health
```

## Future Deployments
When deploying new services:
1. Ensure the external network exists: `docker network create focushive-shared-network`
2. Use `focushive-shared-network` in docker-compose.yml
3. Reference other services by their container names

## Comments Added
Each network configuration now includes explanatory comments:
```yaml
# Using shared network to enable communication with identity-service, notification-service, and focushive-backend
# This prevents network isolation that causes UnknownHostException between services
```

This documents **why** the shared network is used and prevents future developers from accidentally breaking inter-service communication.
