# Docker Configuration Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Security: Removed Internal Service Port Exposures

**focushive-backend/docker-compose.yml:**
- Removed PostgreSQL port 5432 exposure
- Removed Redis port 6379 exposure

**notification-service/docker-compose.yml:**
- Removed RabbitMQ AMQP port 5673 exposure
- Kept management UI port 15673 for development

### 2. Network Standardization

All services now use `focushive-shared-network`:
- **focushive-backend**: Changed from `focushive-network` to `focushive-shared-network`
- **buddy-service**: Changed from `focushive_buddy_service_network` to `focushive-shared-network`
- **identity-service**: Already using `focushive-shared-network` ✓
- **notification-service**: Already using `focushive-shared-network` ✓

### 3. Final Port Allocation

| Service | Application Port | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| focushive-backend | 8080 | Main API |
| identity-service | 8081 | OAuth2/Authentication |
| notification-service | 8083 | Notifications |
| buddy-service | 8087 | Buddy System |
| buddy-service | 8088 | Management/Actuator |

### 4. Internal Services (Not Exposed)

| Service | Internal Port | Network Access Only |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | ✓ |
| Redis | 6379 | ✓ |
| RabbitMQ | 5672 | ✓ |

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Database and cache services not accessible from host
2. **Network Isolation**: Internal services only accessible within Docker network
3. **Service Communication**: All services can communicate via shared network
4. **No Port Conflicts**: Each service has unique exposed ports

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create shared network
docker network create focushive-shared-network

# Start services
cd services/focushive-backend && docker-compose up -d
cd services/identity-service && docker-compose up -d
cd services/notification-service && docker-compose up -d
cd services/buddy-service && docker-compose up -d
```

## Verification

```bash
# Check only application ports are exposed
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep -E "(8080|8081|8083|8087|8088)"

# Verify no database/cache ports exposed
docker ps | grep -E "(5432|6379)->.*tcp" || echo "✓ No internal ports exposed"
```
