# Integration Tests Reality Check

## Summary
During the 6-hour sprint on UOL-44 integration tests, comprehensive test files were created but **NONE were actually tested or verified to work**.

## What Was Created vs Reality

### Created:
- ~150+ test methods across 3 services
- TestContainers infrastructure setup
- OAuth2, JWT, CRUD, WebSocket test files
- Extensive test documentation

### Reality:
- **0 tests were run**
- **0 tests compile successfully**
- **Most tests call non-existent methods**
- **Service assumptions were incorrect**

## Specific Issues Found

### Identity Service Tests
**File**: `JwtTokenValidationIntegrationTest.java`
- Used `JwtService` - doesn't exist (actual: `CookieJwtService` + `JwtTokenProvider`)
- Called methods like `generateAccessToken()` - don't exist in CookieJwtService
- Methods like `isTokenValid()`, `extractUsername()` - not in actual service
- Date assertions were incorrect

**File**: `OAuth2AuthorizationCodeFlowIntegrationTest.java`
- Status: Unknown, likely similar issues

### FocusHive Backend Tests
**Files**: `HiveCrudIntegrationTest.java`, `TimerSessionIntegrationTest.java`, etc.
- Status: Not tested, likely have similar service mismatch issues
- May reference non-existent services or methods

### API Gateway Tests
**Files**: All Kotlin test files
- Status: Not tested, unknown if they compile
- WireMock setup untested

## Root Causes

1. **No verification loop** - Tests were created but never run
2. **Assumptions over investigation** - Assumed service structure without checking
3. **Copy-paste development** - Created similar patterns without validation
4. **Time pressure** - Rushed to create quantity over verified quality

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always run tests immediately** after creating them
2. **Check actual service methods** before writing tests
3. **Start with one working test** then expand
4. **Verify compilation** before moving to next test
5. **Quality over quantity** - 10 working tests > 150 broken tests

## Next Steps Required

1. **Audit actual services** - Document what methods actually exist
2. **Rewrite tests** to match actual codebase structure
3. **Start small** - Get one test working first
4. **Run continuously** - Test each addition immediately
5. **Focus on critical paths** - Auth, basic CRUD, core features

## Time Impact

- **Time spent**: ~6 hours creating untested code
- **Time needed to fix**: Estimated 4-6 hours to rewrite properly
- **Technical debt created**: High - misleading test coverage

## Recommendations

1. Delete or clearly mark all untested code as DRAFT
2. Start fresh with actual service investigation
3. Implement TDD properly - test first, verify, then expand
4. Use existing working tests as templates
5. Focus on integration with actual running services
