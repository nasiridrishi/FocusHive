# Architecture Decision Record: Monolith to Microservices Migration

## Status
**Implemented** - FocusHive has been successfully refactored from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture (January 2025)

## Context

### Initial Monolithic Architecture Issues

FocusHive initially started as a monolithic Spring Boot application with all features packaged within a single deployable unit. While this approach enabled rapid initial development, significant architectural problems emerged as the project evolved:

#### 1. **Compilation and Build Issues**
- **Circular Dependencies**: Multiple packages had circular dependencies, causing compilation failures
- **Tangled Codebase**: Features were tightly coupled, making it impossible to build individual components
- **Build Failures**: Single compilation error would break the entire application
- **Development Bottlenecks**: Developers couldn't work independently on different features

#### 2. **Scalability Limitations**
- **Resource Allocation**: All features consumed the same server resources regardless of actual usage patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Entire application had to be scaled even when only specific features needed more resources
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: High-traffic features (e.g., real-time presence) affected low-traffic features (e.g., analytics)
- **Database Contention**: All services competing for the same database connections

#### 3. **Development and Maintenance Challenges**
- **Team Conflicts**: Multiple developers modifying the same codebase led to frequent merge conflicts
- **Testing Complexity**: Unit testing became difficult due to inter-service dependencies
- **Deployment Risk**: Single deployment could affect all features, requiring extensive regression testing
- **Technology Lock-in**: All features had to use the same technology stack and framework versions

#### 4. **Operational Issues**
- **Single Point of Failure**: If any component failed, the entire application went down
- **Monitoring Complexity**: Difficult to identify which specific feature was causing performance issues
- **Log Management**: All logs mixed together, making debugging specific features challenging
- **Security Risks**: Security vulnerability in one feature could compromise the entire system

## Decision Drivers

### Primary Drivers
1. **Immediate Technical Issues**: Resolve compilation failures and enable successful builds
2. **Development Velocity**: Enable parallel development across multiple teams/developers
3. **Scalability Requirements**: Support different scaling needs for different features
4. **Fault Isolation**: Prevent cascading failures across the system
5. **Technology Flexibility**: Allow different services to evolve independently

### Business Requirements
- **High Availability**: Core features (presence, chat) need 99.9% uptime
- **Performance Isolation**: Real-time features shouldn't affect analytical processing
- **Future Growth**: Architecture must support adding new features without affecting existing ones
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage based on feature-specific needs

### Academic Goals
- **Learning Outcomes**: Demonstrate understanding of distributed systems architecture
- **Industry Relevance**: Apply modern architectural patterns used in production systems
- **Technical Complexity**: Show ability to handle complex system design challenges

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Continue with Monolithic Architecture
**Approach**: Refactor the existing monolith to resolve dependency issues

**Pros:**
- Lower operational complexity
- Simpler debugging and monitoring
- No network latency between components
- ACID transactions across all features

**Cons:**
- Scalability limitations persist
- Single point of failure remains
- Technology lock-in continues
- Team coordination overhead remains high
- Build and deployment risks unchanged

### Option 2: Modular Monolith
**Approach**: Restructure code into clear modules within a single deployable unit

**Pros:**
- Better code organization
- Reduced coupling between features
- Single deployment unit
- No distributed system complexity

**Cons:**
- Still shares resources and scaling limitations
- Single point of failure remains
- Limited technology flexibility

### Option 3: Microservices Architecture (Selected)
**Approach**: Extract distinct business capabilities into independent, deployable services

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Technology flexibility per service
- Fault isolation and resilience
- Team autonomy and parallel development
- Clear service boundaries
- Resource optimization

**Cons:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency and reliability concerns
- Data consistency challenges
- Distributed debugging complexity
- Infrastructure overhead

## Decision Outcome

**Selected Option 3: Microservices Architecture**

### Rationale
The microservices approach was chosen because:

1. **Immediate Problem Resolution**: Solves compilation and build issues by isolating services
2. **Technical Benefits**: Enables independent scaling, deployment, and technology choices
3. **Academic Value**: Demonstrates advanced architectural patterns and distributed systems knowledge
4. **Industry Relevance**: Mirrors real-world enterprise architecture decisions
5. **Future Proofing**: Provides foundation for continued growth and evolution

### Service Decomposition Strategy

The monolith was decomposed into 8 specialized microservices based on business capabilities:

1. **focushive-backend** (Port 8080) - Core hive management and user coordination
2. **identity-service** (Port 8081) - OAuth2 authentication and user identity management
3. **music-service** (Port 8082) - Spotify integration and collaborative playlists
4. **notification-service** (Port 8083) - Multi-channel notification delivery
5. **chat-service** (Port 8084) - Real-time messaging and communication
6. **analytics-service** (Port 8085) - Productivity tracking and insights
7. **forum-service** (Port 8086) - Community forums and discussions
8. **buddy-service** (Port 8087) - Accountability partner matching and management

## Implementation Approach

### 1. **Database per Service Pattern**
- Each service has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database
- Eliminates database contention and allows independent schema evolution
- Services: `focushive`, `identity_db`, `focushive_music`, `notification_service`, `chat_service`, `analytics_service`, `forum_service`, `buddy_service`

### 2. **API Gateway Pattern**
- NGINX serves as API gateway and reverse proxy
- Routes requests to appropriate services based on URL patterns
- Provides centralized SSL termination and load balancing

### 3. **Service Discovery and Communication**
- Container-based service discovery using Docker networking
- Synchronous communication via REST APIs
- Asynchronous communication via Redis pub/sub for real-time features

### 4. **Shared Infrastructure**
- Centralized Redis for caching and real-time messaging
- Shared logging volume for centralized log aggregation
- Common health check and monitoring endpoints

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
