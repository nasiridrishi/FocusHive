## Pre-Recording Checklist
1. [ ] Start demo mode: `./demo-mode.sh`
2. [ ] Login as demo user: demo@focushive.com / demo123
3. [ ] Open browser in light mode (better for video)
4. [ ] Clear browser cache/history for clean demo
5. [ ] Close unnecessary tabs and applications
6. [ ] Set screen resolution to 1280x720 or 1920x1080
7. [ ] Test microphone audio levels
8. [ ] Have multiple browser windows ready (to show multi-user interaction)

## Video Script

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00-0:30)
**[Show FocusHive logo/landing page]**

"Hello, I'm [Your Name], and today I'll be demonstrating FocusHive, a virtual co-working and co-studying platform designed to combat isolation and boost productivity for remote workers and students.

FocusHive addresses a critical challenge: how do we maintain focus and accountability when working or studying alone? Our solution creates virtual 'hives' where users experience passive accountability through shared presence, without the fatigue of constant video monitoring."

### Scene 2: Technical Architecture Overview (0:30-1:00)
**[Show architecture diagram from report]**

"For this prototype, I've implemented the real-time presence system - the technical heart of FocusHive. This feature demonstrates the integration of two project templates:
- Emotion-aware adaptive interfaces from Interaction Design
- Secure identity management from Advanced Web Design

The system uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates, JWT authentication for security, and React with TypeScript for a responsive user interface."

### Scene 3: Dashboard and Room Selection (1:00-1:30)
**[Navigate to Dashboard]**

"Let me show you how it works. After logging in, users see the dashboard with available focus rooms. Notice we have both work-focused rooms like 'Deep Work Zone' and study rooms like 'Exam Prep Hub'. Each room shows real-time participant counts.

The dummy data system I've implemented simulates realistic user activity - you can see different rooms have varying numbers of participants, just like a real platform would."

### Scene 4: Real-time Presence Demonstration (1:30-2:30)
**[Join a populated room]**

"Let's join this study room. Immediately, you can see the real-time presence indicators. Each participant has a status - focusing, studying, on break, or in discussion. These update instantly when users change their status.

[Click to change your status]

Watch as I change my status to 'focusing' - the update happens in real-time for all participants. The color-coded system makes it easy to see at a glance who's actively working."

**[Open second browser window]**

"To demonstrate the real-time synchronization, let me open another browser and join as a different user. Notice how both views update simultaneously when either user changes status. This WebSocket implementation ensures sub-second latency for all presence updates."

### Scene 5: Adaptive UI and Features (2:30-3:30)
**[Show UI adaptations]**

"FocusHive implements adaptive design principles. During focus sessions, users can minimize distractions with our clean mode. 

[Toggle to minimalist view]

See how the interface simplifies - the chat collapses to a floating button, the sidebar hides, keeping only essential elements visible. This demonstrates our emotion-aware design philosophy.

[Point to integrated timer at top]

Notice the integrated Pomodoro timer at the top - it's always visible and synchronized across all participants. This shared rhythm helps everyone take breaks together, maintaining the balance between focus and rest."upc o

### Scene 6: Gamification and Community (3:30-4:00)
**[Navigate to leaderboard]**

"To encourage consistent participation, we've implemented gamification. The leaderboard tracks daily and weekly focus time, with achievements for milestones. This creates positive accountability without surveillance.

[Show forum briefly]

The community features allow asynchronous interaction between focus sessions, building connections between users who share similar goals."

### Scene 7: Technical Achievements and Conclusion (4:00-4:30)
**[Return to focus room]**

"This prototype successfully demonstrates:
- Real-time presence synchronization across multiple clients
- JWT-authenticated WebSocket connections  
- Adaptive UI responding to user needs
- A scalable architecture supporting multiple concurrent rooms

With over 190 passing tests, the implementation proves the technical feasibility of FocusHive's core concept: creating meaningful virtual co-presence without invasive monitoring.

Thank you for watching. FocusHive shows how thoughtful technology design can support both productivity and well-being in our increasingly remote world."

## Production Notes

### Recording Software Options
1. **OBS Studio** (Free, recommended)
   - Set up multiple scenes for smooth transitions
   - Use Display Capture for screen recording
   - Add audio input for microphone

2. **QuickTime** (Mac built-in)
   - Simple screen recording with audio
   - File > New Screen Recording

3. **Loom** (Free tier available)
   - Easy recording and sharing
   - Built-in editing tools

### Recording Tips
1. **Practice the demo flow** 2-3 times before recording
2. **Speak clearly and at moderate pace** - not too fast
3. **Use mouse pointer** to highlight features you're discussing
4. **Pause briefly** between sections for clarity
5. **Keep energy up** - enthusiasm helps engagement

### Post-Production Checklist
1. [ ] Trim any dead space at beginning/end
2. [ ] Ensure audio is clear and consistent
3. [ ] Add title card with project name and your details
4. [ ] Export as MP4 (H.264 codec for compatibility)
5. [ ] Keep file size reasonable (<100MB)
6. [ ] Test playback on different devices

## Alternative Script (Shorter Version - 3 minutes)

If you need a more concise version, focus on:
1. Introduction (20 seconds)
2. Quick architecture overview (20 seconds)
3. Core presence demo with multi-user (90 seconds)
4. Adaptive UI demonstration (40 seconds)
5. Technical achievements summary (10 seconds)

Remember: It's better to clearly demonstrate fewer features than rush through everything!
