1.1 Project Idea 1: Data-Driven Personalised Educational Content  
Recommendation  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Can we leverage advanced data science techniques to build a highly accurate and personalised educational content recommendation system?  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
The explosion of online learning resources presents a challenge: how do learners find the  
most relevant materials? Traditional recommendation systems often rely on simplistic  
metrics. This project aims to apply sophisticated data science methods to understand individual learning patterns and preferences. By analysing large datasets of user interactions, content metadata, and learning outcomes, we can build models that predict optimal learning pathways. This involves exploring techniques from machine learning, natural  
language processing, and network analysis to create a system that truly personalises the  
educational experience, improving knowledge retention and learning efficiency.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.

(Google’s resources on recommendation systems)  
• https://scikit-learn.org/(Scikit-learn documentation for machine learning)

• https://www.nltk.org/ (NLTK documentation for natural language processing)  
• Research papers on "Educational Data Mining" and "Learning Analytics" (search on  
Google Scholar or ACM Digital Library)  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product should be a data-driven recommendation engine, likely implemented as  
a Python API or a web service. It should demonstrate the ability to process user data, apply machine learning models, and generate personalised recommendations. The project  
should include a thorough evaluation of the model’s performance using relevant data science metrics.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A prototype would demonstrate the core data science pipeline: data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and recommendation generation. It needs to prove that the chosen algorithms can learn from data and produce meaningful recommendations. It’s important to clearly show the data transformations and model outputs.

1.2 Project Idea 2: Predictive Modelling of Social Media Trend  
Emergence  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Can we develop a data-driven model that predicts the emergence and spread of trends on  
social media platforms?  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Social media platforms are dynamic environments where trends rapidly emerge and evolve.  
Understanding these trends is crucial for businesses, marketers, and researchers. This  
project aims to apply data science techniques to analyse large-scale social media data  
and build predictive models. By analysing factors such as user engagement, content characteristics, and network structure, we can identify patterns that indicate the potential for  
a trend to gain traction. This project will explore how data science can be used to forecast and understand the dynamics of social media trends, providing valuable insights for  
strategic decision-making.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
  
• https://www.tweepy.org/ (Python library for accessing Twitter API)  
• https://networkx.org/ (Python library for network analysis)  
• https://scikit-learn.org/ (Scikit-learn documentation for machine learning)  
• Research papers on "Social Media Trend Analysis," "Network Diffusion," and "Time  
Series Forecasting" (search on Google Scholar or ArXiv)  
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets (Kaggle datasets for social media data)  
  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product will be a predictive model implemented in Python, along with a report  
detailing the data analysis, model development, and evaluation. It should demonstrate  
the ability to process social media data, extract relevant features, and predict the likelihood of a trend’s emergence. The project should include visualizations of trend patterns  
and model performance metrics.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A prototype would demonstrate the core data science pipeline: data collection (e.g., using APIs), preprocessing (e.g., text cleaning, feature extraction), model training (e.g., using time series models or machine learning classifiers), and trend prediction. It needs to  
prove that the model can identify patterns associated with trend emergence. It is important to show the data transformations and the model’s predictive capabilities. A real time  
dashboard is not important at this stage.

2 CM3010 Databases and Advanced Data  
Techniques  
2.1 Project Idea 1: Working with works–a new approach to music  
cataloguing  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Create a portal for catalogues of works by classical composers  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Book publications listing all music by a classical composer have been around for centuries  
(e.g. Mozart kept one). Software for creating digital lists was developed in 2014 by the  
Danish national library to support a catalogue of the works of Carl Nielsen. This system  
uses MEI XML to encode catalogue data, a Java-based XML database, and a Java web  
forms manager for data entry. The original publication system could generate a PDF (for  
printing) and web pages.  
This software is hard to maintain, and inflexible. As a result, when the Danish library stopped  
supporting development, and a German university took over, the publication system stopped  
working.  
You should identify ways to work with existing catalogues, currently encoded in XML. Decide whether to keep the data as it is or transform it into a different model (e.g. JSON, SQL  
or Linked Data), and then make a new interactive web interface for exploring the catalogues.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.

Final Project Ideas  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
  
• A user-friendly website for exploring musical works, and their themes, performances  
and manuscripts  
• A web API for work catalogue data  
• Transformation scripts to convert MEI works catalogues into a different database  
model (optional).  
• An evaluation of the MEI catalogue model, with recommendations (optional).  
What would a prototype look like?  
The catalogue information in MerMEId is complex. A prototype would take only the most  
basic data and extract it into a form that can be used for the Web API. The prototype should  
then consist of a basic API and web front end for this reduced data model.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
Data modelling and transformation, information retrieval, UI/UX, web programming.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
A clear evaluation and recommendation for an alternative to the current system, first steps  
towards that system, including data pipeline, API and UI.  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
1. The project must engage with some of the complexities of the data model (not everything needs to be covered, but more than just title and composer).  
2. The website should make sense and be appropriate to the data.  
3. Web API and backend structure should be clearly thought through and well argued.  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
Data from a catalogue has been taken and used to build a live website.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A significant proportion of the original data model has been implemented, and most data  
transformed and presented to the users in a new way.

For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
A perceptive evaluation of the data model and alternative approaches, which could be  
taken further. A significant proportion of the original data model has been implemented,  
and most data transformed and has been presented to the users in a new way that potentially unlocks new insights into the data. The catalogues of multiple composers can be  
explored together, or connected to other sources of information (such as Wikidata, Musicbrainz or IMSLP).

2.2 Project Idea 2: Reconciliation service for a dataset  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
You will implement or adapt a Reconciliation Service API for a dataset of your choice to  
support connecting it to other data.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Datasets become far more powerful when they are connected together – for example, a  
database with references to places can become more useful if those places can also be  
connected to socio-economic or historical information about those places. Identifying  
common entities between datasets is often a manual, time-consuming task. OpenRefine  
is an example of software designed to make the task easier, but is most effective at connecting data to a dataset which has a Reconciliation API available. Wikidata has this, for  
example.  
A Reconciliation Service API allows software to query entities from a data table and retrieve possible matches from the dataset. It is possible to implement a server for this  
from scratch, but tools have been developed including at least one Python library.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
  
• The API itself is maintained by a W3.org community group at https://www.w3.  
  
org/community/reconciliation/. This group develops the documentation for  
the evolving standard.  
• An example of a library for implementing the API is here: https://github.com/  
derenrich/py-reconciliation-service-api.  
• A description of the goals by a host of one service is here: https://blog.museum-digital.  
org/2024/07/03/reconciliation-apis-arrive-to-museum-digital/  
• The originator of the API and main client software is OpenRefine: https://openrefine.  
org/  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
  
• A description of the dataset being used, including evaluation of the data consistency  
  
and reliability and assessment of any data cleaning needs;  
• An implemented reconciliation API as a server. This need not be feature complete  
(the standard allows implementations with minimal functionality);  
• An example of data being reconciled with the original dataset, using a client that calls  
the API;  
• Evaluation of the efficacy of the API – what works and what would need more data or  
more development.  
  
13 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
What would a prototype look like?  
A working API server, but with hard-coded or minimal data. The documentation lists a set  
of possible functional elements, but very little needs to be implemented for the server to  
conform.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
Data transformations, advanced web development, text search/information retrieval, data  
modelling.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
Good system architecture, efficient database searches, good selection of fields to expose  
in the API, good choice of dataset(s)  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
1. The API must be successfully called by a client (OpenRefine, probably).  
2. It must be possible to reconcile matching data.  
3. Close matches should, ideally, also be retrieved, with sensible criteria for relevance.  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
A minimal API – the reconciliation service exists, can be connected to OpenRefine, and  
conforms (more or less) to the standard.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A functional API – the service exists, can be connected to from OpenRefine, and returns  
relevant matches when identical strings of the right datatype appear in the data.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
An interesting, well-chosen dataset is exposed through the API – the service works from  
within OpenRefine, and has been tested with a relevant second dataset. Approximate  
matching, or matching on multiple fields has been implemented. The resulting combined  
dataset would support further research. A test framework has been written and checks  
aspects of the API against the specification.

3 CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural  
Networks  
3.1 Project Idea 1: Neural Style Transfer  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Neural Style Transfer is a generative deep learning technique for altering images to make  
them appear to have been painted in a particular style. For example, a cityscape of skyscrapers and flyovers as if painted in the characteristic circular brush strokes Van Gogh.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
The idea is to merge a preserve the content of an image (a cityscape) whilst adopting a  
reference style (for example, Van Gogh’s Starry Night). Style transfer is related to the area  
of texture generation in computer vision, but the power of deep learning takes the process  
to new level. Within the deep learning approach, content, a global property of an image, is  
captured by the upper levels of a convnet whereas style, a local property, is represented  
in multiple lower layers. Transfer proceeds by the minimisation of a loss function which  
measures the style and content distance between the original and the generated image.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
  
• Gatys, L.A., Ecker, A.S. and Bethge, M., 2016. Image style transfer using convolu-  
  
tional neural networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision  
and pattern recognition (pp. 2414-2423).

review. IEEE transactions on visualisation and computer graphics, 26(11), pp.33653385.  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
A portfolio of stylised images.  
A study of the relationship between deep learning architectures, hyperparameter settings  
and outputs.  
What would a prototype look like?  
An NST system with default settings, as suggested, for example in Chollet’s book.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
Machine learning; deep learning; a deep learning library such as Tensorflow or PyTorch.

What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
A series of deep learning statistical models.  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
A review of content manipulation by various styles, and of different contents with the  
same style.  
A survey of the complete hyperparameter space for a particular neural architecture.  
An understanding of minimal models and maximal models and the sensitivity of outputs  
to hyperparameters such as the weighting between style and content distances.  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
A working NST system with some investigation of hyperparameter adjustment.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A good survey of hyperparameter settings, different architectures (e.g. various VGG models) and production, with comment, of a variety of content and style couplings.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
Novel adaptations (e.g. different optimisers) of readily available code (e.g. from tensorflow.org and Chollet’s book). Imaginative applications e.g. video neural style transfer.  
Qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Multiple style models. Something comparable in  
range to the early review paper of Jing et al.

3.2 Project Idea 2: Deep Learning Breast Cancer Detection  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
The aim is to establish if Deep Learning assisted X-ray mammography can improve the  
accuracy of breast cancer screening. The project will achieve this aim by modelling the  
Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) with convolutional neural networks  
(CNNs).  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
The UK national health service (NHS) launched, in early 2025, a major research project  
to address the above research question. If successful, a DL system could replace one of  
the two radiologists currently reporting on scans with the consequence of faster diagnostic turn-around and the liberation of specialists for other tasks. CNNs are deep learning  
neural networks that apply a succession of filters to the input layer. They are capable of  
impressive image recognition tasks.

4 CM3020 Artificial Intelligence  
4.1 Project Idea 1: Orchestrating AI models to achieve a goal  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project is based around the idea of combining multiple pre-trained models into a  
workflow that achieves a particular goal. It is up to you to decide what that goal is. For  
example, in the artificial intelligence course, you saw how it is possible to combine multiple models to generate lyrics, music and a singing performance for a pop song. You do not  
need to address a creative problem like this, but you do need to combine multiple models  
to solve a well specified problem. Below we provide some starting ideas for the kinds of  
models you might work with. You should think of a problem space (e.g. music, cybersecurity, creative writing, education, healthcare) then build a system that can operate in that  
space based around multiple pre-trained models operating on different types of data.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Many pre-trained models are now available that allow ‘artificially intelligent’ computer  
programs to extract information from the world, and to generate information to put back  
into the world. As a final year computer science student, we would like to challenge you  
in this project to identify a problem space that you feel is important to you and to build a  
system that can operate in that problem space. The system should make use of several  
pre-trained models to make sense of the world and to put information into the world.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
Example of the kinds of pre-trained models you can use are as follows. Note that these  
links are valid and working at the time of publication of this document. You should be able  
to use them as starting points to find working models.  
1. Speech to text: transcribes audio containing speech into text e.g. openai whisper:  
https://github.com/openai/whisper  
2. Language processing and generation: using local language models to understand and  
generate text e.g. ollama: https://ollama.com/  
3. Image to text: Image analysis and description, detect objects in images, describe images e.g. mobilenet: https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/  
master/mobilenet and  
https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base  
4. Audio to text: audio scene description e.g. yamnet https://huggingface.co/  
STMicroelectronics/yamnet and https://github.com/tensorflow/tfhub.  
dev/blob/master/assets/docs/google/models/yamnet/1.md  
5. Sentiment analysis: detect emotions in text https://huggingface.co/tabularisai/  
multilingual-sentiment-analysis  
6. Human body and face analysis, for example ml5 models for hands and poses: https:  
//docs.ml5js.org/  
19 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
7. Other sources: You can find many pre-trained models for many different tasks here:  
https://huggingface.co/models  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product should consist of a working piece of software that can be used to achieve  
your specified goal or to operate in your specified problem space. The product should include at least THREE pre-trained models, operating in different domains/ data spaces, for  
example, text, image and audio. You should clearly state what the purpose of the system  
is and show how you went about identifying, operationalising, testing etc. your models. It  
is likely that you will have to go through a process of testing and rejecting models to find  
the ideal choices for your project. We would like to see evidence of that process and your  
decision making process.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A prototype should show the chosen models operating successfully, generating and processing data in several different models, with a clearly described objective or purpose for  
the overall system.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
This project will involve working through lots of different models – getting them working,  
testing them out to see if they will work with the data you want to use. We want you to use  
your software engineering and testing skills here.  
You will need to work with different types of data, figuring out how to feed it into the different models.  
You should show that you can evaluate pre-trained models for example by sending test  
data and validating the outputs.  
Also you might need to test the performance of the models and to relate this to the system you are building and how it shall be used.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
We are keen to see evidence that you have tested several models and made decisions  
about which are and are not appropriate for your needs. One aspect of this will be testing the performance of the models to see if they are viable to use for your project. We will  
want to see evidence that you have thought about how to combine different models to  
achieve an overall system goal.  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
As noted above, we anticipate that you will be installing and testing lots of different models in order to figure out which ones are appropriate for your needs. You should evaluate  
  
20 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
your process here and be able to come up with an overarching method for doing this. You  
should ensure that you meet the requirement to have at least THREE pre-trained models  
working on different types of data in the project. You should ensure that the project delivers a working system that achieves a clear goal. Just downloading some models and  
running them is not enough!  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
A minimum pass would include a working system which includes three pre-trained models working to achieve a clearly specified goal. There should be evidence that you have  
evaluated the models using appropriate criteria.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A 2:2 – 2:1 project would include a working system which includes three pre-trained models working to achieve a clearly specified goal. You should have chosen a challenging goal  
which is not easily achievable using standard software engineering techniques and automation – it should be clear why these pre-trained models are needed. We are looking  
for an integrated piece of software here. We would like to see evidence of software testing, ideally with unit testing but potentially with users as well.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
An outstanding project would use an original approach to address an interesting and challenging problem. We would like to see evidence that you have thoroughly explored the  
space of pre-trained models relevant to your project and chosen appropriate models based  
on evidence presented in the report. You should choose a difficult problem and consider  
the best way to design the user interaction. We want to see thorough evaluation of the  
models and solid software testing, including user testing and iteration of the design based  
on the testing results.

4.2 Project Idea 2: Financial Advisor Bot  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project involves the creation of a financial advisor bot. The bot analyses financial data  
in order to make recommendations for a dynamic investment strategy, which you might  
also call ‘active portfolio management’.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
You will need to identify which kind of financial systems the bot will advise about. For example, the stock market, currency exchange market, crypto-currencies, classic car trading  
and so on.  
You will need to decide what kind of AI/ML techniques you will use to implement the bot.  
We recommend that you use techniques that you have seen in the course, for example,  
modelling the problem as ‘decision making under uncertainty’ would lend itself to reinforcement learning. Or you might attempt to evolve an investment strategy.  
It should be possible for a non-technical user to interact with the bot to receive advice, for  
example, via a web interface. The bot should present its analysis and recommendations to  
the user with explanations. For example, the bot might say ‘NVIDIA stock is likely to rise  
by 25% so we recommend taking up a position on that now and exiting after 20% growth’.  
It is up to you to decide how the bot presents this advice. You could consider using local  
language models to format the recommendations into prose.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
You can find stock price data feeds:  
https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance  
Or crypto data feeds:  
https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt  
You might need a backtesting system to test your advisor’s trading strategies:  
https://github.com/topics/backtesting  
You might consider using local language models to help the user interact with the advisor bot. For example, you might conceive of the bot as a tool-using agent. The following  
systems might prove useful:  
https://ollama.com/  
https://docs.openwebui.com/  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product would be an integrated and tested system designed for non-technical  
users to use. You will probably need separate systems for training models and gathering  
data, if you choose to do that. We would not expect the non-technical user to be able to  
  
22 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
interact with the model training system. But they should be able to interact with the advisor bot once trained. You should present evidence that you have evaluated the advice that  
the advisor bot generates.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A prototype would need to have the main parts functioning but it would not need to have  
the full user interface. So you would need a way to interact with the advisor bot, even if  
it is command line based. You would need to identify appropriate data sources and to  
gather and ingest that data.. You would need a way for the advisor bot to analyse and/ or  
learn from data.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
You can choose how to implement the advisor bot, but reinforcement learning, evolutionary strategies, neural networks and so on would be the typical techniques. You might  
want to use some language model techniques as well.  
You will need to do some significant software engineering and testing here so you would  
need the techniques from the degree relating to those.  
There is also a strong data science component around gathering and analysing data.  
Web programming will be needed to create the web interface.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
  
• We expect to see well tested software  
• We expect to see a solid data analysis and machine learning/ AI workflow implemented  
• We expect to see a working web user interface  
  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
We imagine that you will work iteratively on designing, implementing and testing the components of the system. The components include the data gathering, training, advisor bot  
interaction, web interface.  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
A basic project should present a complete working system but with limited complexity of  
components. We would need to see some design, implementation and evaluation work.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A 2:2-2:1 project should present a complete working system with some significant development and testing work evident in some or all of the components. You should present  
23 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
some detailed evaluation of the components of the system and clear planning. We would  
want to see some thought put into the design of the advisor bot and its algorithm in particular.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
An outstanding project should present a complete working system with some significant  
development and testing work evident in all of the components. You should present detailed evaluation and testing of the components of the system and clear planning. We  
would expect the advisor bot to implement some sort of interesting and advanced algorithm with significant effort put into it.

5 CM3025 Virtual Reality  
5.1 Project Idea 1: VR Game Escape Room  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
The project aims to create an immersive VR escape room experience using physics-based  
gameplay. It explores how VR can enhance player engagement through interactive narratives and realistic physics interactions. Players must use their body to manipulate objects,  
solve physics-based puzzles, and uncover hidden clues to escape within a time limit. The  
game will leverage environmental storytelling and spatial problem-solving to create a  
deeply immersive and challenging experience.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Virtual Reality offers unparalleled immersion, making it a powerful medium for escape  
room experiences. Physics-based interactions can create engaging and dynamic puzzles that challenge players in new ways. With the rise of VR platforms like Meta Quest and  
SteamVR, there is growing interest in escape room games that fully utilize VR’s unique capabilities. The escape room in this project should draw on your knowledge of both VR and  
game development modules, making full use of VR interaction techniques to create an immersive and interactive environment—rather than simply replicating a traditional escape  
room in VR.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
In addition to the material in the module:  
  
• Online store fronts such as Steam, the Meta Store and VIVEPort are the best places  
  
to find interesting VR games and experiences for inspiration.  
• The Room VR: A Dark Matter, I Expect You To Die, Escape Simulator VR, A Fisherman’s Tale, AVO Escape Space, Escape Legacy VR are some examples of the diversity  
of gameplay and style that is possible in VR.  
• 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice by Bowman et al. is a very good starting  
point for VR interaction techniques  
• The IEEE VR, Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST), ACM SIGGRAPH and  
GDC conference proceedings are an excellent source of cutting edge techniques  
• The Book of Puzzles and Enigmas - Fabrice Mazza for puzzles inspiration  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
A playable VR game demonstrating multiple escape room mechanics through a narrativedriven experience and/or physics-based gameplay mechanics. It should include player  
interactions, sound design, and visual effects. It should:  
  
• include a suitable VR navigation technique;  
25 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
  
• make use of, and show off the unique features of VR (it would not work as a screen  
based game);  
• not cause significant nausea or discomfort.  
  
The ultimate goal for the final product will be a fully functional VR game suitable for play  
with a VR headset, aligning closely with the project brief’s goals. VR escape room would  
feature a single, fully interactive room with a cohesive theme. Players would start in a  
locked environment and need to solve a series of physics-based puzzles to escape. Core  
mechanics would include grabbing, pushing, rotating, and assembling objects using VR  
hand-tracking or controllers. Simple interactions, like pulling levers, pressing buttons, or  
stacking objects to reach new areas, would showcase the game’s physics engine. Environmental storytelling elements, such as hidden clues, interactive props, and dynamic lighting, would enhance immersion. The game would prioritize smooth locomotion, intuitive  
controls, and a balanced difficulty curve, ensuring players engage with the space naturally. Additionally, a timer or hint system could be implemented to guide players without  
breaking immersion. It will demonstrate core gameplay mechanics and showcase VR’s  
unique capabilities through:  
  
• Full-body interaction: Players will engage physically with the environment, using ges-  
  
tures, body movement, or hand tracking to drive gameplay.  
• VR navigation technique: A suitable movement system, such as teleportation or  
continuous locomotion, will be implemented to support gameplay and immersion.  
• VR-exclusive design: The experience will leverage VR’s spatial, interactive, and  
immersive qualities, making it a uniquely VR-first experience that could not be replicated on a standard screen.  
• Comfort-focused design: The game will integrate comfort techniques, such as snapturning or vignetting, to minimize motion sickness and ensure accessibility.  
  
What would a prototype look like?  
  
• The prototype should demonstrate the core gameplay loop, highlighting the main  
  
player interactions and mechanics. It should be engaging, simple to pick up, and  
show potential for deeper complexity as gameplay progresses. The prototype must  
clearly convey what the player is doing and how they are meant to engage with the  
game. It should include basic mechanics and broad aspects of level design, such as  
objectives or challenges.  
• At this stage, it is crucial to focus on gameplay and interaction rather than visuals.  
Placeholder objects like boxes or basic shapes are acceptable, and advanced graphics or sound design are unnecessary. The key is to prove that the gameplay concept  
works and is compelling in its simplest form.

Final Project Ideas  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
  
• Iterative development.  
• Frequent playtesting.  
• VR Interaction design.  
• Unity/C#.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
  
• A series of incrementally improving prototypes – showing how you have tested and  
  
incorporated feedback from play testers.  
• Some aspects of the game have been dropped from the first iterations, some have  
been added, some have been modified, in line with AGILE development practices.  
• Several sets of feedback from players that inform your ongoing development and design process.  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
Student will use play testers and solicit feedback on the developing game. Main source  
of data will be player opinions and, where possible, player actions where it is possible to  
directly observe playtesting. Student should also use standard metrics such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and a presence questionnaire to assess how well it works in  
VR.  
Example Criteria for the Student’s Iteration Process (VR Physics-Based Game):  
Gameplay Mechanics and Interaction:  
Core Mechanics: Evaluate the implementation of physics-based interactions, such as  
object manipulation, collisions, and environmental responses. Are these interactions intuitive and engaging in VR?  
VR-Specific Features: Assess how the game utilizes full-body interactions and VRspecific navigation techniques (e.g., teleportation, hand-tracking).  
Performance and Optimization:  
Frame Rate and Responsiveness: Measure frame rates during gameplay. Does the  
game maintain a consistent, comfortable frame rate to minimize motion sickness?  
Real-Time Rendering: Evaluate performance with applied physics simulations and  
shaders. Is the game optimized for real-time play on VR hardware?  
Player Experience and Immersion:  
Player Feedback: Gather feedback from testers on VR interactions and physics realism.  
Are the controls intuitive and immersive?  
Comfort: Assess the game’s comfort level, ensuring it minimizes nausea through  
appropriate design choices (e.g., smooth locomotion or teleportation).

5.2 Project Idea 2: VR Educational Experience  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project aims to create an immersive VR educational tool, helping users learn about a  
complex real life topic through interactive, hands-on experiences. The topic could be anything from history to physics to recycling and global warming. The focus is on immersive,  
experiential learning that goes beyond traditional methods.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Virtual Reality (VR) holds immense potential for learning because it offers the ability to  
directly experience scenarios that would otherwise be inaccessible. VR can enhance traditional classroom learning by allowing users to interact with virtual representations of concepts, such as molecules in chemistry. It can extend to vocational training, such as practicing surgical procedures or assembling complex machinery. VR can also provide experiential learning opportunities, such as visiting historical locations or exploring underwater  
ecosystems. Additionally, VR has been used effectively for empathy-building experiences,  
such Stanford VR’s Becoming Homeless. These experiences are impactful because they  
go beyond simply conveying information—they immerse users in the subject matter, creating a deep, lasting understanding through direct interaction and perspective-taking.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
  
• Online store fronts such as Steam, the Meta Store and VIVEPort are the best places  
  
to find interesting experiences for inspiration.  
• Experience on Demand by Jeremy Bailenson is a great book about VR in general but  
experiential learning in particular.  
• 3D User Interfaces: Theory and Practice by Bowman et al. is a very good starting  
point for VR interaction techniques.  
• The IEEE VR, Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST), ACM SIGGRAPH and  
GDC conference proceedings are an excellent source of cutting edge techniques.  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product will be a fully functional VR experience that allows users to learn through  
experience. It should be 3-5 minutes of experience It will have the following game design  
characteristics:  
  
• Allows users to experience a simulation of an experience and learn from it  
• It minimises explicit “telling” via voice overs or text, and should focus on learning by  
  
doing and through experience  
• Includes suitable VR interaction and navigation techniques that are as close as possible to the real experience  
• Makes use of, and shows of the unique features of VR (it would not work as a screen30 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
based game)  
• Does not cause significant nausea or discomfort  
  
What would a prototype look like?  
Prototype needs to show a core VR interaction technique that simulates how people would  
interact with the experience in the real world. At the first prototype the focus should be on  
reproducing the experience rather than on learning yet.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
  
• Iterative development  
• Frequent playtesting  
• VR Interaction design  
• Unity/C#.  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?  
  
• A series of incrementally improving prototypes – showing how you have tested and  
incorporated feedback from play testers.  
• Some aspects of the experience have been dropped from the first iterations, some  
have been added, some have been modified, in line with AGILE development practices.  
• Several sets of feedback from participants that inform your ongoing development  
and design process.  
  
How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
Student will use testers and solicit feedback on the developing experience. The main measure should be how well they learn. This could be done by testing before and after the experience on a tasks and see how much they improve. In some cases this could be about  
factual knowledge (e.g. about history of Ancient Greece or Han Dynasty), in others it could  
be practical skills (assembling machinery) or changes in attitude (experiencing being homeless). Another source of data will be participants’ opinions and, where possible, actions  
where it’s possible to directly observe playtesting. Students should also use standard  
metrics such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and a presence questionnaire to assess how well it works in VR. Criteria for the Student’s Iteration Process (VR Educational  
Experience):  
1.  
  
Learning Experience Quality:  
a. Educational Impact: Does the VR experience effectively teach or demonstrate  
the intended concept? Are learning objectives clear and engaging?  
b.

6 CM3030 Games Development  
6.1 Project Idea 1: Custom Car Physics for Racing and Open-World  
Driving Games  
6.1.1 What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project focuses on developing a realistic custom car physics system for use in racing or open-world driving games. The goal is to create an accurate and responsive vehicle  
handling model that considers factors such as suspension, tire friction, weight transfer.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Many driving games rely on physics models that simulates real-world vehicle dynamics.  
While arcade racing games prioritise accessibility, simulation-based games require more  
advanced physics for realism. This project will explore real-world vehicle dynamics principles and implement them within a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. Features  
such as realistic acceleration, braking, drifting, and suspension behaviour will be integrated into the physics system. Inspiration can be drawn from games like "Assetto Corsa,"  
"BeamNG.drive," and "Forza Motorsport," which demonstrate high-fidelity driving physics.

6.2 Project Idea 2: Procedural Dungeon Generation in Roguelike  
Games  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project explores the implementation of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques to create dynamic and unique dungeon layouts for roguelike games. The goal is to  
design an algorithm that generates varied and playable dungeons while ensuring balanced  
gameplay.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Roguelike games, such as "The Binding of Isaac" and "Hades," heavily rely on procedurally generated dungeons to provide an engaging and unpredictable gameplay experience.  
Procedural generation allows for the creation of infinite variations of levels without manually designing each one. However, designing a procedural algorithm that ensures playability, challenge progression, and aesthetic appeal is a complex task. This project will involve  
researching existing PCG methods, such as cellular automata and BSP (Binary Space Partitioning), to create an effective dungeon generator. The outcome will be a working prototype demonstrating dynamically generated levels, ensuring balance in enemy placement,  
rewards, and difficulty scaling.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
· "Procedural Content Generation in Games" by Noor Shaker, Julian Togelius, and Mark  
Nelson. · "Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom. · Unity/Godot/Unreal  
documentation on procedural generation techniques.  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
A fully functional prototype of a roguelike game with procedurally generated dungeon  
levels. The game should include randomised room layouts, enemy placements, and item  
distributions while maintaining a structured difficulty curve.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A basic 2D or 3D dungeon explorer with procedurally generated rooms, corridors, and interactive elements such as enemies, doors, and loot. The prototype should showcase a  
variety of generated layouts and allow player navigation.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
  
• Procedural content generation (PCG)  
• Data structures (graphs, trees, BSP trees)  
• Algorithm design (random walk, cellular automata, Perlin noise)  
• Pathfinding algorithms (A* for enemy AI movement)

7 CM3035 Advanced Web Design  
7.1 Project Idea 1: Identity and profile management API  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
We have different names, usernames and ways of presenting ourselves in different contexts. Devise a Web API to manage them securely and flexibly.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Many people present themselves differently in different contexts. Some have legal names  
that differ from the names they use in their daily lives, or use middle names or numbers to  
distinguish similarly-named individuals. In some cultures, their given names may be only  
used administratively, and in other cases, they may have special names for religious use.  
On marriage, people may change their legal names, but not use the new name professionally. Meanwhile, online, we manage many identities, usernames and profiles of ourselves.  
Which identity we use depends on context, but also on who is asking for the information  
and why. You will devise a REST API for reading and writing identities to a server securely  
and sensitively, so that users requesting information about an individual get the correct  
preferred name for the context about which they are enquiring. Confidential information  
should be concealed as necessary, and users should only be able to write data where this  
is appropriate.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
  
• For context about naming, a reasonable start is the Wikipedia article (https://en.  
wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name), but better references should be found.  
• For secure account management and REST API creation, course materials should  
provide a good start.  
• A good understanding of the HTTP protocol will be helpful – e.g. students might use  
Accept-language in content negotiation in this context. An overview is at https://  
developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation  
  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
A requirement specification (based on literature survey and, optionally user consultation)  
for an identity management system An implementation that at least covers names and,  
optionally, adds gender identities, online profile data and other relevant information.  
What would a prototype look like?  
A completed API, a backend datastore and a UI. Some form of authentication and user  
management will be necessary.

How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
  
•  
•  
  
A good understanding of the user needs  
A well-thought-through API  
  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
To pass, an implementation must be secure and have appropriate user management. It  
must at least cover names used in different contexts. Several different types of use must  
be implemented, and the API must have clear logic.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A requirements document with evidence of reading and thinking about the contexts. Strong  
security and privacy decisions. An API that supports a good variety of use contexts. An example web front end works and is user-friendly and accessible.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
A strong requirements document that shows research and imagination. Solid security and  
privacy, possibly with reference to GDPR and optionally using external authentication. The  
data model goes beyond the simplest use cases. The API is robust and would be widely  
applicable. A web front end clearly demonstrates multiple use cases for the API.

7.2 Project Idea 2: NextTrack: A music recommendation API  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Design a music recommendation API that gives a ‘next track’ based on an HTTP request,  
providing listening history and some preference parameters, along with data about the  
tracks available.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Music recommendation and playlist generation systems are popular and much researched.  
It’s quite common for these to operate within applications that users log into, and which  
profile that user based on their listening habits. This has implications for privacy. It can  
also be undermined by shared accounts and listening (for example, a household with a  
child, may wind up with nursery rhymes in the recommendations).  
You will build a RESTful recommendation system with no user tracking instead, the user  
will provide a sequence of track identifiers that the next track should follow from, and  
some preference parameters (which you can choose). The system will use data from external sources, such as musicbrainz, genius.com, spotify, Wikidata to inform its choices.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.  
The ISMIR conference (ismir.net) has many papers on recommender systems that should  
give an idea of the sorts of things you could do. There’s no necessity to use audio features  
– some of Brian Whitman’s work in early ISMIR conferences uses non-content information, such as metadata and online reviews.  
What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
A RESTful API that takes a set of track identifiers and other parameters and returns the id  
of a suitable next track. There should be some form of evaluation (for example, based on  
user testing or some prior work giving good sequences).  
What would a prototype look like?  
The basic API. This could return tracks at random for prototyping purpose, but it should  
reproduce the input/output format. If a frontend is to be implemented, a basic implementation with music player (e.g. via YouTube or logged in Spotify).  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
Web API, UI/UX, Music information Retrieval

Final Project Ideas  
What would the output of these techniques/processes/CS fundamentals look like?

How will this project be evaluated and assessed by the student (i.e. during iteration of  
the project)? What criteria are important?  
  
• A good overview of playlists/recommender systems and what users might want  
• A well-thought-through RESTful API that offers some user control  
• Sensible evaluation of the results  
For this brief, what might a minimum pass (e.g. 3rd) student project look like?  
A working API that gets some data from elsewhere, and combines it with user-provided  
information to choose a track.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
A literature review that identifies a good strategy for recommending the next track, a working API that offers real choice to the user. A Web application that demonstrates that the  
API works. Good evaluation (such as user testing)  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
An insightful overview of recommendation approaches and the data that is available to a  
server process. An API that recommends based on well-chosen parameters. A web application that provides an interactive music playing experience. Strong user testing and reflection on the results of it (ideally, modifications based on user testing, which are themselves tested).

8.2 Project Idea 2: Towards a Low-cost Resilient Early-warning Natural  
Disaster Monitoring, Notification and Rapid Response Platform  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project aims to develop a framework and a low-cost Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based  
technological solution to allow local authorities to monitor, notify impacted regions, communities and individual homeowners to prepare for potential natural disaster such as  
flooding, wildfire and even a spread virus such as COVID19.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Traditional methods such as TV, radios and telephones for relaying emergency or warning  
messages to impacted population of people in given region has proven to be challenging  
for the local authorities due to various factors such as damages to network infrastructure,  
electricity outage and viruses. Despite the early prediction of excessive rainfall and risk  
of flooding / landslides, there were many lives still lost mainly due to lack of awareness  
and preparedness to handle such natural disasters which are only becoming more unpredictable due to the climate change. Therefore, a low-cost IoT-based solution should be  
developed to overcome some of the above factors.

and momentum. Physics-based games are popular for their engaging, dynamic gameplay, where players interact with objects in a realistic virtual environment. Examples include games like Angry Birds, Portal, or Human: Fall Flat, which leverage physics to create  
entertaining and sometimes unpredictable challenges. The project requires implementing at least two levels with increasing difficulty, encouraging players to master game mechanics progressively. The first level should introduce core gameplay concepts and simple  
challenges, while the second level should increase complexity with additional obstacles,  
time limits, or environmental hazards. This project will develop technical skills such as 3D  
modeling, physics engine integration (e.g., Unity’s Rigidbody and Colliders), and gameplay  
scripting. It also fosters creativity in level design, user experience, and balancing difficulty  
to maintain player engagement.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.

What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product will be a fully playable 3D physics-based game with at least two levels,  
each offering increasing difficulty and unique challenges. The game will feature a welldesigned 3D environment with interactive objects and realistic physics behaviours such as  
gravity, collisions, and object dynamics.  
The gameplay should be a maximum of 5 minutes. Shorter and more polished is preferable and will receive higher marks than longer and not as well executed.  
It will have the following game design characteristics:  
  
• Easy to pick up and play.  
47 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
  
• Uses physics simulation as a key element of gameplay.  
• Include an additional level/state with complexity (in the form of increased speed,  
  
obstacles etc).  
• May optionally use other elements of the 3D Graphics and Animation course, such as  
keyframe animation and shaders, to enhance the effect.  
• 3rd party assets may be used for graphics, animation and audio, but you must have  
permission and credit them appropriately.  
What would a prototype look like?  
The prototype will showcase the core physics-based gameplay loop, highlighting the  
main mechanics that make the game engaging, challenging, and easy to pick up, while  
demonstrating potential for emergent complexity. It will clearly define what the player is  
meant to do and how they will interact with the game world to achieve their objectives.  
The focus will be on gameplay mechanics and level design, not on visuals or sound. The  
prototype will use simple shapes such as boxes, spheres, and capsules to represent objects, characters, and obstacles. Players will be able to interact with these objects using  
physics-based actions like pushing, stacking, rolling, or launching. Core mechanics such  
as gravity, collisions, and object responses to player input will be functional. The prototype will also include basic versions of at least two levels, showcasing progressively increasing difficulty and demonstrating how mechanics combine to create engaging challenges.

• Core Gameplay Loop: A simple, functional physics-based mechanic (e.g., rolling a  
  
ball through a maze or knocking over objects) that clearly shows what the player is  
meant to do and how they interact with the environment.  
• Two Levels: Two distinct levels with increasing difficulty, though level design may be  
simplistic or repetitive. The second level should introduce at least one new challenge  
(e.g., moving platforms, obstacles, or a time limit).  
• Basic Physics Implementation: Use of built-in physics (e.g., gravity, collisions, and  
object movement) with occasional glitches or inconsistencies.

keyboard for movement and interaction).  
• Limited Feedback: Minimal player feedback (e.g., basic win/lose conditions) with no  
scoring or sound effects.  
• Written report lacks research, detail of process, issues encountered in production,  
and/or doesn’t name influences or audio-visual assets used appropriately.  
For this brief, what might a good (e.g. 2:2 – 2:1) student project look like?  
  
• Core Gameplay Loop: A clearly defined and engaging physics-based mechanic (e.g.,  
  
rolling a ball through obstacles, stacking objects to solve puzzles, or using momentum to cross gaps). The gameplay should be intuitive, challenging, and show potential for emergent complexity.  
• Two Well-Designed Levels: Two distinct levels with increasing difficulty and clear  
progression. The first level should introduce core mechanics, while the second level  
should build on them with additional challenges, such as moving obstacles, timers, or  
interactive objects (e.g., pressure plates, seesaws, or trampolines).  
• Improved Physics Implementation: Realistic use of physics components (e.g., rigidbodies, colliders, forces) with consistent object behaviour. Basic mechanics such as  
jumping, pushing, or stacking objects should function smoothly.

functional user interface (e.g., start, restart, and level selection) and clearly indicate  
win/lose states.  
• Better Controls: Responsive and intuitive player controls with smooth movement and  
interactions, such as dragging objects or using physics-based switches.  
• Basic Game Loop: A full gameplay loop, including starting the game, playing through  
levels, and displaying a victory or game-over screen.  
• Slight Visual/Audio Polish: Placeholder assets with some basic improvements (e.g.,  
simple textures, lighting, or background music) to enhance the player experience,  
though the focus remains on gameplay. Possibly using keyframe animation and/or  
shaders.

clear the influences that went into the game (e.g. games played and analysed, which  
mechanics were inspired from where etc.).  
• Audio-visual assets appropriately credited.  
• Playtesting feedback is clearly gathered and acted on.  
For this brief, what might an outstanding (e.g. 1st) student project look like?  
  
• Game is highly-polished technically, and in terms of audio-visual presentation.

• Possibly also using advanced animation and shader techniques  
  
50 of 73  
  
Final Project Ideas  
  
• Game requires no instructions – it’s very clear what the objective is and how to achieve  
it from the opening screen.  
• Game is easy to start playing, but repeated play shows a well-selected set of simple mechanics that lead to depth and emergent complexity as the player replays the  
game over several sessions.  
• Written report has excellent and concise writing style. Research and influences behind the project are clear and detailed, with extensive analysis of background works.  
• Playtesting has been frequent/ongoing, extensive feedback has been gathered and  
documented and it’s very clear how this has been incorporated into the iterative development of the game.

9.2 Project Idea 2: Animated Short film with VFX  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project aims to use GPU shader techniques to create a distinctive and visually striking style for a short, animated film developed in Unity. By leveraging real-time rendering,  
lighting and custom shaders, the film will showcase a unique aesthetic that highlights the  
creative potential of modern game engines for cinematic storytelling.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
The rise of real-time game engines like Unity has revolutionized animation, making it possible to produce high-quality animated films without the long rendering times traditionally  
associated with offline rendering techniques. This shift is largely due to advances in GPU  
programming, which enable diverse visual styles ranging from photorealism to stylized  
effects like cel-shading or glitchy cyberpunk aesthetics.  
In particular, real-time shaders, such as custom lighting, post-processing effects, and particle systems, play a crucial role in defining the look and feel of a scene. Shaders can simulate everything from dynamic lighting and reflections to atmospheric effects like fog, fire,  
or holograms.  
This project will explore the artistic potential of shaders to establish a cohesive visual  
style, blending animation with real-time rendering techniques. The final outcome will be  
a short film that highlights how modern GPU effects can transform storytelling and evoke  
emotion through distinct visual aesthetics.

movement created using keyframes, physics simulations (e.g., rigidbodies, collisions), or particle effects (e.g., smoke, fire, or water).  
• GPU Shader Effects: Custom or built-in GPU shaders should be applied to specific  
objects to produce distinctive visual effects (e.g., water reflections, toon shading).  
• Lighting Design: The scene should feature appropriate lighting (e.g., dynamic shadows, global illumination, baked vs real-time) that complements and enhances the  
overall visual style.  
• Technical Showreel Format: The project will be assessed on visual quality and technical execution rather than narrative or storytelling. The presentation should highlight the use of shaders and effects.  
• Use of Third-Party Assets: Students may incorporate third-party models, animations, and audio, but proper credits and permissions must be provided. Focus:  
• Visual Polish: Shorter, well-executed films will receive higher marks than longer,  
less-polished ones.  
• Technical Implementation: Clear demonstration of shaders and rendering techniques.  
• Style and Presentation: Effective use of lighting and effects to create a cohesive  
aesthetic.  
What would a prototype look like?  
Prototype needs to show at least one of the key shader techniques that will be used. It  
can be applied to simple objects, not necessarily the final scene.  
What kinds of techniques/processes/CS fundamentals are relevant to this project?  
  
• Iterative development  
• Unity/C#.  
• 3D scene design  
• Keyframe Animation

11 CM3055 Interaction Design  
11.1 Project Idea 1: Designing an Online Empathy Simulation to Help  
Caregivers  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Caregivers often struggle to fully understand the emotional and physical challenges faced  
by those they care for. This project aims to create an online empathy simulation tool that  
helps caregivers’ step into the shoes of their care recipients, fostering greater empathy  
and understanding.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Caregiving is a demanding role that requires not just physical effort but emotional intelligence and compassion. Yet, caregivers frequently lack experiential tools to deeply connect with the realities of their care recipients’ lives, such as living with dementia, physical  
disabilities, or chronic conditions. This project explores how interaction design can create  
immersive scenarios that replicate these challenges, allowing caregivers to experience  
these realities firsthand. By incorporating reflective feedback and user-centric design, this  
tool will help caregivers develop the empathy needed to provide more compassionate and  
effective care.

11.2 Project Idea 2: Designing an Emotion-Aware Adaptive Email and  
Task Manager to Reduce Workplace Stress  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
Workplace stress is a significant challenge, especially when employees are overwhelmed  
with emails, deadlines, and task lists. Traditional email and task management tools can  
increase stress by bombarding users with complex interfaces, too many notifications, and  
no support for mental well-being. This project aims to develop an emotion-aware email  
and task management interface that detects user stress levels and adapts the experience  
to provide a calmer, more supportive workspace.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
In a fast-paced work environment, email overload and constant task management contribute to stress and burnout. Emotion-aware systems offer a solution by adapting to a  
user’s emotional state. This project focuses on an email and task manager application  
that uses emotion detection to tailor its interface. For example, if the user appears stressed,  
the system might reduce notification frequency, prioritise critical emails, or switch to a  
simplified interface. It can also provide features like calming themes, motivational prompts,  
and short stress-relief activities. This application promotes productivity while supporting  
emotional well-being in a demanding work environment.  
Here are some recommended sources for you to begin your research.

What would the final product or final outcome look like?  
The final product will be a functional prototype of an email and task manager app that:  
  
• Detects stress levels via facial expressions, typing speed, or voice tone.  
• Dynamically adapts features, such as:  
– Simplified UI to highlight high priority emails or tasks.  
– Reduction of notifications during stress peaks.  
– Stress-relief options like short guided breathing exercises or calming themes.

in research in the computing disciplines.  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
All research should be guided by a process that begins with the researcher’s philosophical  
world view and then details why the research has value, how the research was done, and

13.2 Project Idea 2: Multi-human Detection and Activities Tracking in a  
Shared Space  
What problem is this project solving, or what is the project idea?  
This project aims to detect, identify individuals and track their activities within a smart  
space using live image and audio signals. Based on the individual activities, personalised  
support or early predictions of health-related issues could be performed in the future.  
What is the background and context to the question or project idea above?  
Emerging ambient assisted living systems are being developed to support individuals conduct activities of daily living by themselves. However, these systems are unable to accurately tell who is performing what activities in a shared living environment in order to provide personalised support. These activities conducted by individuals in shared space may  
have a common goal or they are conducting their own parallel activities. Another aspect  
of this project is the privacy concerns when using computer vision and audio signalling  
methods on cloud computing resources that are also costly for the end user and take huge  
amount of energy to communicate over busy network connections. One area of investigation is adapting hybrid edge and cloud computing paradigms to perform model training in  
the cloud and supporting and storage locally on resource constrained edge devices.
