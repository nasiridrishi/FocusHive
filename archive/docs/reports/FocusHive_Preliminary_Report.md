## 1. Introduction

The rapid shift to remote work and online education has fundamentally transformed how we collaborate, learn, and maintain productivity. While this transition offers unprecedented flexibility and accessibility, it has also introduced significant challenges that traditional digital tools have struggled to address. Research has shown that remote workers frequently report decreased productivity, with lack of accountability and social isolation cited as primary factors (Microsoft Work Trend Index, 2023). Similarly, students engaged in online learning face unique challenges including difficulty maintaining focus during self study sessions, lack of peer accountability that traditional study groups provide, and increased procrastination without the structure of physical learning environments. This productivity challenge is compounded by the emergence of "Zoom fatigue" and the psychological toll of constant digital surveillance through employee monitoring software or proctoring systems. There exists a critical need for innovative solutions that can foster productivity and accountability for both professionals and students while respecting user well-being and privacy.

FocusHive emerges as a response to this challenge, proposing a novel approach to virtual co-working and co-studying that prioritizes both productivity and mental health. At its core, FocusHive is a digital platform that creates virtual "hives" â€“ dedicated online spaces where professionals can work on their tasks and students can engage in focused study sessions while maintaining a sense of shared presence and mutual accountability with others. Whether preparing for exams, working on assignments, completing professional projects, or conducting research, users benefit from the motivational presence of peers without distraction. Unlike traditional video conferencing tools that demand constant visual attention, or invasive monitoring software that creates stress through surveillance, FocusHive implements a philosophy of "passive accountability" that motivates through community rather than control.

The platform's innovation lies in its flexible presence system and synchronized productivity features, creating an environment that supports users while maintaining the social benefits of working or studying alongside others. When users join a FocusHive session, they enter a shared digital space where their presence is felt without being intrusive. Students preparing for exams can use synchronized Pomodoro timers to maintain focus with peers. Professionals in deep work sessions benefit from visible accountability without video fatigue. The system provides productivity tracking through focus streaks, achievement systems, and synchronized break reminders. This collaborative approach transforms the typically isolating experience of remote work and online study into one that feels supportive and connected.

The motivation for developing FocusHive stems from both personal observation(I have been a full time freelancer) and empirical research. The isolation of remote work and online study affects not just productivity but mental health, with studies documenting increased anxiety among both remote workers and distance learning students compared to their in person counterparts (World Health Organization, 2023). Current solutions tend to address either productivity or well-being, but rarely both. Task management applications like Asana or Trello organize work but lack social presence. Study apps like Forest or StudyBunny provide focus timers but miss the accountability of real study groups. Video conferencing platforms like Zoom provide connection but create fatigue through constant engagement. Academic monitoring software and proctoring systems increase accountability but damage trust and create test anxiety. FocusHive recognizes that productivity and well-being are not opposing forces but complementary aspects of sustainable remote work and effective online learning.

The significance of this project extends beyond addressing immediate remote work and education challenges. As hybrid work models become permanent fixtures of the professional landscape and online education continues to expand globally, tools that support healthy, productive remote collaboration will become essential infrastructure for both sectors. FocusHive's approach: combining collaborative features with technical sophistication, represents a new paradigm for productivity technology that prioritizes human connection alongside professional outcomes and academic achievement. By demonstrating that productivity tools can be both effective and supportive, the project aims to influence future development in workplace technology and educational platforms, creating environments where both professionals and students can thrive.

FocusHive's implementation draws primarily from two sophisticated project templates that combine to create its unique value proposition. The primary template, CM3055 Interaction Design's "Emotion-Aware Adaptive Email and Task Manager," provides inspiration for creating user-centered interfaces. While the template focuses on emotion-aware features, FocusHive's prototype emphasizes the foundational elements of presence tracking, synchronized timers, and gamification to create engagement without requiring emotional monitoring. This approach prioritizes user privacy while still creating supportive digital environments.

The secondary template, CM3035 Advanced Web Design's "Identity and Profile Management API," supplies the robust technical architecture necessary for a secure, scalable platform. This template's focus on managing user identities across different contexts proves essential for FocusHive, where users must feel secure sharing their presence while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries. The template's emphasis on RESTful API design and secure authentication provides the foundation for FocusHive's real-time features and cross-device synchronization capabilities.

The integration of these two templates creates a practical foundation. The user-centered design principles from the Interaction Design template guide the creation of intuitive presence indicators and productivity features, while the Advanced Web Design template provides the authentication and real-time synchronization infrastructure. This combination demonstrates how templates from different computing disciplines can inform a cohesive platform design, even when not all advanced features are implemented in the initial prototype.

This report documents the development of FocusHive from concept to working prototype, providing insights into both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation challenges. Chapter 2 presents a comprehensive literature review examining research in virtual collaboration, emotion-aware computing, gamification, and real-time web technologies, with particular attention to both workplace productivity and educational effectiveness research. Chapter 3 details the system design, explaining how the two primary templates are integrated into a cohesive architecture that supports the diverse needs of remote workers and online students. Chapter 4 documents the implementation and evaluation of a core feature prototype â€“ the real-time presence system â€“ demonstrating the feasibility of the concept for both professional co-working and academic study sessions. Through this progression, the report illustrates how academic research, thoughtful design, and technical implementation combine to address real-world challenges in remote work and online education.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Introduction

The development of FocusHive, a digital co-working and co-studying platform that promotes shared focus and mutual accountability through collaborative features, requires a comprehensive understanding of multiple research domains. This literature review examines six key areas: virtual collaborative environments (including both professional and educational contexts), gamification in productivity and learning, social presence theory, emotion-aware computing, real-time web technologies, and existing solutions in the digital co-working and virtual study space. By synthesizing insights from these domains, this review identifies the unique opportunity for FocusHive to address current gaps in supporting both remote workers and online students through a unified platform.

The review examines how user-centered design principles from the Interaction Design template (CM3055) can be integrated with robust web architectures from Advanced Web Design (CM3035) to create a solution that supports well-being while maintaining productivity in remote environments.

### 2.2 Virtual Study and Work Groups

The concept of virtual collaborative environments has evolved significantly with the shift to remote work and education. Smith et al. (2020) introduced Virtual Study Groups (VSG) as a fundamental component of virtual learning systems, defining them as student-formed groups with similar educational needs who collaborate to support mutual learning and problem solving. Their research emphasizes VSGs' critical role in maintaining high student motivation through collaborative efforts, describing them as a "backup system" for sustaining engagement in virtual spaces.

The effectiveness of such virtual groups was empirically validated in a randomized controlled trial (Bawa et al., 2023) examining study-together groups in an online chemistry course. The study found that students offered study-together groups reported a significantly higher sense of belonging compared to control groups. Particularly noteworthy was the increased peer study likelihood during the intervention phase, with students from lower academic preparation backgrounds showing the most substantial improvements. However, the research also revealed an important caveat: highly motivated students experienced negative effects on time management, suggesting the need for adaptive systems that can cater to diverse user needs.

These findings directly inform FocusHive's core "hive" concept, validating the approach of creating dedicated virtual spaces for collaborative work. The platform addresses the time management concerns by implementing customizable participation levels and adaptive features that respond to individual user states and preferences.

### 2.3 Gamification in Productivity Applications

The integration of gamification elements in productivity tools has shown significant promise for enhancing user engagement and outcomes. A systematic literature review by Li & Wang (2023) analyzing 39 empirical studies on gamification in e-learning identified key effective elements including points, badges, leaderboards, levels, feedback, and challenges. Critically, the review found that only 9 studies utilized theoretical frameworks such as self-determination theory, highlighting a significant gap in the principled application of gamification.

This gap in theoretical grounding was addressed by a comprehensive meta-analysis (SaadÃ©Â etÂ al.,Â 2023) examining gamification effectiveness across 41 studies. The analysis reported substantial positive effects for gamification on learning outcomes. The study identified important moderating factors: higher education users benefited more than secondary school learners, science disciplines yielded larger effects, and surprisingly, offline settings outperformed online environments. This last finding presents a particular challenge for FocusHive, necessitating careful design of gamification elements that can overcome the reduced effectiveness in online settings.

FocusHive addresses these insights by grounding its gamification design in self-determination theory, focusing on group-based rather than competitive individual metrics. The platform's shared focus streaks and collective hive goals create a supportive rather than competitive environment, potentially mitigating the online effectiveness gap through enhanced social connection.

### 2.4 Social Presence in Virtual Environments

Social presence â€“ the degree to which participants feel connected and "there" with others in a virtual environment â€“ is crucial for the success of online collaborative platforms. Akcaoglu and Lee (2016) conducted a pivotal study comparing small group (4-5 students) and whole class discussions in graduate-level online courses. Their findings revealed significant advantages for small groups across multiple dimensions including sociability, social space, and group cohesion.

The research demonstrated that small, permanent groups foster deeper engagement and stronger interpersonal connections, though participants noted challenges with coordinating timely participation. This insight directly influenced FocusHive's design decision to implement small, persistent hives rather than large, open spaces. The platform addresses the coordination challenge through real-time presence indicators and flexible asynchronous features that maintain group cohesion even when members cannot be simultaneously present.

### 2.5 Emotion-Aware Computing and Workplace Well-being

The integration of emotion-aware computing in workplace applications represents a frontier in human-computer interaction that directly addresses modern concerns about remote work stress and burnout. Picard's foundational work in affective computing (Picard, 1997) established the theoretical framework for systems that can recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions. This field has evolved to encompass non-intrusive methods of emotion detection that respect user privacy while providing valuable adaptive capabilities.

Recent research by Zhang et al. (2023) on workplace stress and technology interventions found that remote workers experience unique stressors including isolation, difficulty in work-life separation, and "Zoom fatigue" from constant video presence. Their study revealed that a majority of remote workers desired technology solutions that could help manage stress without requiring constant active engagement. This finding directly supports FocusHive's approach of passive presence through activity patterns rather than invasive monitoring.

McDuff and Czerwinski (2018) from Microsoft Research developed frameworks for detecting workplace stress through keyboard and mouse patterns, demonstrating that non-invasive behavioral signals can effectively indicate user emotional states. Their work showed that typing speed variations, mouse movement patterns, and application switching behaviors correlate strongly with self-reported stress levels. This research provides theoretical insights that could inform future development of privacy-respecting productivity features in platforms like FocusHive.

The importance of adaptive interfaces in supporting workplace well-being was further demonstrated by Kumar et al. (2022), who studied the effects of context-aware UI adjustments on user stress levels. Their experimental study found that interfaces that automatically adapted based on detected stress states (simplifying layouts, reducing notifications, changing color schemes) showed significant improvements in both user stress levels and task completion rates. These findings suggest potential future enhancements for platforms like FocusHive, where interface adaptations could support user well-being.

### 2.6 Real-time Collaboration Technologies

The technical foundation for modern collaborative platforms relies heavily on real-time web technologies. The evolution from traditional HTTP request-response patterns to persistent WebSocket connections has enabled the kind of immediate, synchronized experiences that FocusHive requires. Fette and Melnikov's (2011) WebSocket protocol specification (RFC 6455) established the standard for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling the low-latency updates essential for presence awareness.

Recent work by Liu et al. (2023) on scalable real-time collaboration architectures identified key patterns for maintaining consistency across distributed clients while minimizing latency. Their research on conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) and operational transformation (OT) algorithms provides solutions for the challenging problem of maintaining synchronized state across multiple users. While FocusHive's presence system doesn't require the complexity of collaborative editing, these principles inform the platform's approach to maintaining consistent room state across participants.

Security considerations in real-time collaborative systems have been extensively studied by Chen and Wong (2022), who identified critical vulnerabilities in WebSocket implementations and proposed mitigation strategies. Their work emphasizes the importance of proper authentication, message validation, and rate limiting â€“ all of which are implemented in FocusHive's architecture to ensure secure real-time communication.

### 2.7 Critical Analysis and Synthesis

The reviewed literature reveals both opportunities and challenges for FocusHive's development. While virtual study groups demonstrate clear benefits for motivation and belonging (Smith etÂ al.,Â 2020; BawaÂ etÂ al.,Â 2023), existing implementations often lack features that could better support individual user needs. Current platforms typically fall into two categories: video conferencing tools that create "Zoom fatigue" through constant visual presence, or task management applications that lack the social accountability component.

The gamification research presents a nuanced picture. While the large effect sizes reported in the meta-analysis (SaadÃ©Â etÂ al.,Â 2023) are encouraging, the reduced effectiveness in online environments compared to offline settings suggests that simply transplanting game elements is insufficient. FocusHive's approach of grounding gamification in self-determination theory and focusing on collective rather than competitive elements represents an attempt to overcome this limitation.

The emotion-aware computing literature provides strong support for non-intrusive detection methods, but also highlights the technical challenges of accurate state inference from behavioral signals alone. The balance between providing adaptive features and avoiding creepy or invasive monitoring remains delicate. FocusHive's prototype prioritizes user privacy by focusing on explicit productivity features rather than inferential state detection.

Perhaps most significantly, the literature reveals a gap in platforms that successfully integrate all these elements. While some tools offer virtual presence (like Focusmate), gamification (like Forest), or adaptive interfaces (like various "focus mode" applications), few combine collaborative accountability with privacy-respecting design and synchronized productivity features. This synthesis of features, grounded in the reviewed research, positions FocusHive to address unmet needs in the remote work and study ecosystem.

### 2.8 Conclusion

This literature review has examined research across six domains relevant to FocusHive's development. The evidence strongly supports the efficacy of virtual collaborative environments for enhancing motivation and belonging, while also highlighting the importance of small group dynamics and social presence. The emotion-aware computing literature provides theoretical frameworks that could inform future development of stress-reducing features in productivity platforms. Technical research on real-time web technologies offers implementation patterns for creating responsive, synchronized experiences.

The synthesis of these findings reveals a clear opportunity for FocusHive to address current gaps by integrating collaborative productivity features with social accountability mechanisms in a privacy-respecting platform. By grounding its design in established research while innovating at the intersection of these domains, FocusHive aims to create a novel solution for the challenges of remote work and study in the modern digital environment.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Project Overview

FocusHive is designed as a digital co-working and co-studying platform that seamlessly integrates collaborative interaction design with robust web architecture to create virtual spaces for shared focus and accountability. The platform addresses the core challenges of isolation faced by both remote workers and online students while respecting user privacy and well-being through innovative technical and design choices.

The system enables users to join virtual "hives" â€“ persistent or temporary digital rooms where individuals work on their professional tasks or engage in study sessions while maintaining awareness of others' presence. Hives can be configured for different purposes: deadline-driven work projects, exam preparation groups, dissertation writing sessions, or general productivity spaces. Unlike traditional video conferencing or screen-sharing solutions, FocusHive implements a model of "passive presence" where users feel the motivational benefits of working or studying alongside others without the cognitive burden of constant visual engagement or the privacy concerns of surveillance.

### 3.2 Template Integration Architecture

FocusHive's architecture is built upon the deep integration of two complementary project templates that together create a cohesive and powerful system:

#### Primary Template: CM3055 Interaction Design - User-Centered Interface 

The Interaction Design template provides the user experience foundation, implementing:
- **Presence System**: Real-time status indicators showing who is focusing, studying, or on break
- **Productivity Features**: Synchronized Pomodoro timers, focus streaks, and achievement tracking
- **Collaborative Elements**: Shared break reminders, group achievements, and buddy accountability
- **Gamification Layer**: Points, leaderboards, and achievement badges to motivate continued engagement

#### Secondary Template: CM3035 Advanced Web Design - Identity and Profile Management API 

The Advanced Web Design template provides the technical infrastructure:
- **Secure Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 integration for secure user access
- **Identity Management**: Context-aware user profiles that present different information in different situations (minimal during focus, expanded during breaks)
- **RESTful API Architecture**: Well-structured endpoints for all platform operations
- **Real-time Communication Layer**: WebSocket implementation for presence updates and synchronized state

**Figure 1: Two-Layer Architecture Diagram**
```mermaid

    ac2 --> infra
    ac3 --> infra
    ac4 --> infra

    websocket --> api
    auth --> api
    identity --> api
```

The integration between these layers is bidirectional and continuous. The collaborative features rely on the secure identity management to maintain user privacy while enabling real-time synchronization. The technical infrastructure supports the user experience layer with fast WebSocket updates and secure API endpoints.

### 3.3 System Architecture

FocusHive employs a microservices architecture that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration where needed. This approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and the ability to evolve different components independently.

**Figure 2: System Architecture Overview**

#### Core Services:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and token management using JWT tokens
2. **Presence Service**: Manages real-time user status updates and participant synchronization
3. **Room Service**: Controls room creation, membership, and settings management
4. **Gamification Service**: Tracks points, achievements, and leaderboard rankings
5. **Timer Service**: Manages synchronized Pomodoro sessions across participants

### 3.4 Design Justifications

#### Choice 1: Flexible Presence Options

**Decision**: FocusHive provides multiple presence options including status indicators, screen sharing, and optional video, allowing users to choose their comfort level.

**Justification**: Research on "Zoom fatigue" (Bailenson, 2021) identifies constant video presence as cognitively exhausting. Both remote workers and students need flexibility in how they share their presence. The platform supports screen sharing for those who want to show their work progress, optional video for collaborative sessions, and simple status indicators for minimal presence. This flexibility allows users to maintain accountability while choosing the level of visibility that supports their productivity and comfort.

#### Choice 2: Privacy-First Design with Optional Features

**Decision**: Core functionality focuses on presence and productivity tracking, with emotion detection as a future optional feature requiring explicit user consent.

**Justification**: Privacy concerns are paramount in both workplace and educational applications. Students are particularly sensitive to monitoring given experiences with invasive proctoring software. The platform prioritizes transparent features like Pomodoro timers, focus streaks, and task tracking that users explicitly control. Any future emotion-aware features would be opt-in only, ensuring users maintain full control over their data and privacy.

#### Choice 3: Modular Monolithic Architecture

**Decision**: Single Node.js application with modular service organization for rapid prototyping.

**Justification**: For the prototype phase, a modular monolithic architecture provides faster development iteration while maintaining clean separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into distinct service modules (auth, rooms, presence, gamification) that could be extracted into microservices in future production deployment. This approach balances development speed with architectural clarity.

#### Choice 4: Hybrid Storage Strategy

**Decision**: In-memory storage using JavaScript Map data structures for rapid prototyping.

**Justification**: For the prototype phase, in-memory storage provides the fastest development iteration and simplest deployment. This approach allows immediate testing of real-time features without database configuration overhead. Production deployment would migrate to persistent storage solutions based on learned requirements from prototype usage.

### 3.5 Real-time Presence System Design

The real-time presence system represents the core technical innovation of FocusHive, demonstrating the integration of both templates in a single feature.

**Figure 3: Real-time Presence Flow**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as User A (Client)
    participant Presence as Presence Server
    participant B as User B (Client)

    A->>Presence: 1. Join Hive
    Presence->>B: 2. Broadcast Join
    A->>Presence: 3. Status Update
    Presence->>B: 4. Analyze & Adapt
    Presence->>A: 5. UI Adaptation
```

The presence system maintains user state across three dimensions:
1. **Availability State**: Active, Away, Focusing, In Break, Studying, In Discussion
2. **Emotional State**: Inferred from patterns (Stressed, Focused, Relaxed, Overwhelmed)
3. **Productivity State**: Streak status, session duration, break compliance, study goals progress

![Real-time Presence Indicators](./screenshots/participants.png)
<center>*Figure 5: Real-time presence indicators showing participants in various states (focusing, studying, on break)*</center>

### 3.6 Implementation Plan

Given the project timeline and complexity, development follows an iterative approach with continuous integration of both template aspects:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**
- Set up authentication system (Advanced Web Design template)
- Implement basic user profiles with context awareness
- Create initial React component library with adaptive capabilities
- Establish WebSocket infrastructure for real-time features

**Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-7)**

- Implement break reminder system
- Optimize real-time performance

**Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 11-12)**
- User testing and iteration
- Performance optimization
- Security audit
- Documentation completion

### 3.7 Evaluation Strategy

While the prototype successfully implements the core functionality, formal evaluation is planned for future development phases. The evaluation strategy outlines metrics that would validate the design across multiple dimensions:

#### Planned Technical Metrics (Advanced Web Design):
- **API Response Time**: Measure actual response times under various loads
- **WebSocket Latency**: Test real-time update delivery speed
- **Concurrent User Support**: Stress test with increasing user counts
- **Authentication Security**: Security audit against OWASP guidelines

#### Planned User Experience Metrics (Interaction Design):
- **User Satisfaction**: Surveys on presence system effectiveness for both work and study contexts
- **Productivity Impact**: Measure focus session completion rates and study goal achievement
- **Interface Usability**: User testing of adaptive UI elements across different use cases
- **Privacy Perception**: User comfort with non-video presence approach
- **Academic Performance**: Track correlation between platform use and study outcomes

#### Planned Integration Metrics:
- **Feature Usage**: Analytics on which features users engage with most
- **System Performance**: End-to-end latency measurements
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Verify synchronization across platforms

The current prototype provides the technical foundation for these evaluations, with comprehensive logging and monitoring hooks already implemented. The modular architecture enables easy integration of analytics and performance monitoring tools when formal testing begins.

## 4. Feature Prototype

### 4.1 Feature Selection Rationale

Among the various features planned for FocusHive, the real-time presence system was selected for prototyping as it represents the fundamental innovation of the platform and demonstrates the seamless integration of both primary templates. This feature embodies the core value proposition of FocusHive: creating a sense of shared presence and accountability for both remote workers tackling projects and students preparing for exams, without the invasiveness of traditional video conferencing or monitoring solutions.

The real-time presence system was chosen for several compelling reasons. First, it represents the technical heart of FocusHive, requiring sophisticated WebSocket implementation, state synchronization, and scalable architecture â€“ all key elements from the Advanced Web Design template. Second, it demonstrates adaptive interface principles from the Interaction Design template through dynamic presence indicators and synchronized Pomodoro timers that respond to group activity. Third, unlike simpler features such as user authentication or static UI components, the real-time presence system presents significant technical challenges that demonstrate advanced implementation skills. Finally, this feature is immediately demonstrable and evaluable, providing clear metrics for latency, scalability, and user experience.

The presence system serves as a proof of concept for FocusHive's unique approach to virtual co-working and co-studying. By successfully implementing this feature, we validate the feasibility of creating meaningful social presence with flexible video options (allowing users to choose their visibility level based on comfort), demonstrate the technical architecture's capability to handle real-time updates at scale across diverse use cases, and prove that adaptive features like synchronized timers and presence indicators can enhance both professional and academic productivity.

### 4.2 Technical Implementation

The real-time presence system was implemented using a modern technology stack that prioritizes performance, scalability, and developer experience. The architecture consists of three main components: the client-side presence manager, the WebSocket server, and the state synchronization layer.

#### Client-Side Implementation

The client-side implementation uses React with TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience. The presence system is managed through a custom React context that provides hooks for accessing and updating presence state:

```typescript
// SocketContext.tsx - Core WebSocket management
export const SocketProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState<Socket | null>(null);
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const newSocket = io(SOCKET_URL, {
      auth: { token: localStorage.getItem('token') }
    });
    
    newSocket.on('connect', () => setConnected(true));
    newSocket.on('disconnect', () => setConnected(false));
    
    setSocket(newSocket);
    return () => { newSocket.close(); };
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <SocketContext.Provider value={{ socket, connected }}>
      {children}
    </SocketContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

The integrated timer component provides synchronized Pomodoro sessions across all participants, implementing shared focus periods:

```typescript
// IntegratedTimer.tsx - Synchronized Pomodoro timer component
const IntegratedTimer: React.FC<{ roomId: string }> = ({ roomId }) => {
  const { socket } = useSocket();
  const [timerState, setTimerState] = useState<TimerState | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!socket) return;
    
    socket.on('timer:state', setTimerState);
    socket.on('timer:tick', setTimerState);
    socket.emit('timer:get-state', { roomId });
    
    return () => {
      socket.off('timer:state');
      socket.off('timer:tick');
    };
  }, [socket, roomId]);

  const formatTime = (seconds: number): string => {
    const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
    const secs = seconds % 60;
    return `${mins.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${secs.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
  };

  return (
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-4">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <span className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          {timerState ? formatTime(timerState.remaining) : '25:00'}
        </span>
        {/* Control buttons for start/pause/reset */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Server-Side Implementation

The server uses Node.js with Express and Socket.io for WebSocket communication. The presence service maintains room state and broadcasts updates efficiently:

```typescript
// presenceService.ts - Core presence management
export class PresenceService {
  private participants: Map<string, ParticipantStatus[]> = new Map();
  
  updateUserPresence(socket: Socket, status: ParticipantStatus['status'], currentTask?: string) {
    const roomId = socket.data.currentRoom;
    if (!roomId) return;
    
    const participantList = this.participants.get(roomId) || [];
    const participant = participantList.find(p => p.userId === socket.data.userId);
    
    if (participant) {
      participant.status = status;
      participant.currentTask = currentTask;
      participant.lastActive = new Date();
      
      // Broadcast to all users in room
      this.io.to(roomId).emit('presence:updated', {
        userId: socket.data.userId,
        status: participant
      });
    }
  }
}
```

The presence system tracks user activity patterns for future adaptive features:

```typescript
// Track user focus sessions for analytics
private trackUserActivity(userId: string, activity: ActivityType) {
  const userSessions = this.activityMap.get(userId) || [];
  userSessions.push({
    type: activity,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    duration: 0
  });
  this.activityMap.set(userId, userSessions);
  
  // Emit activity update for real-time dashboard
  this.io.to(`user:${userId}`).emit('activity:update', {
    currentActivity: activity,
    sessionCount: userSessions.length
  });
}
```

#### State Synchronization

The system uses in-memory state management with Socket.io's built-in room functionality:

```typescript
// Real-time state synchronization using Socket.io rooms
private syncPresenceState(roomId: string, update: PresenceUpdate) {
  // Update in-memory state
  const roomState = this.roomStates.get(roomId) || new Map();
  roomState.set(update.userId, {
    status: update.status,
    timestamp: update.timestamp,
    currentTask: update.currentTask
  });
  this.roomStates.set(roomId, roomState);
  
  // Broadcast to all users in the room
  this.io.to(roomId).emit('presence:updated', {
    userId: update.userId,
    status: update.status,
    currentTask: update.currentTask
  });
}
```
