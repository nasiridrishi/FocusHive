# Report Instructions

In this staff graded assignment you are to submit a preliminary draft of some aspects of your project report. The report must consist of four chapters, and have a total maximum word limit of 6000 words (excluding title page, reference list, etc). The chapters required are:

- **An introduction:** this explains the project concept and motivation for the project (this can be based on your proposal). This **must** also state which project template you are using (max 1000 words).
- **A literature review:** this is a revised version of the document that you submitted for your second peer review (max 2500 words).
- **A design:** this is a revised version of the document that you submitted for your third peer review (max 2000 words).
- **A feature prototype**: this is the only new element of the submission, details below (max 1500 words).

The per-chapter maximums are strict, as is the overall word count. Note that the total of the four chapter word counts is 7000 --- this is not an error but it allows you flexibility in the lengths of each chapter, and lets you balance the document to some extent.

You can return to the 3 peer reviews for instructions on the first three parts of this submission. 

The feature prototype should be an implementation of at least one of the most important technical features used in the project to show that it is feasible. It should work as designed, but it is **ok** at this stage if developing the prototype shows that the feature is not as effective as you expected. 

You should describe the prototype in the final chapter of your preliminary report, together with an evaluation of how well you think the prototype works and how you would improve it. This evaluation should be according to appropriate approaches in the particular area you are working in --- for example, evaluation in the Machine Learning area may not be appropriate in the Web Development area. The evaluation you use must be appropriate for your particular project. It is even better if you are able to link your chosen evaluation approach to related background work.

 You must also submit a 3-5 minute video that demonstrates the prototype together with any motivation and discussion that you feel is appropriate.

Final Project – Preliminary Report Rubric

1. Preliminary Report (36 points)

Does the report display knowledge of the area of study, previous work and

academic literature?

**0 points** No

**2 points** No, but... there are some attempts to refer to other work

**3 points** Yes, but… the report some discussion of the area and a few bits of previous work,

but the discussion might be limited, confused or only partially correct

**4 points** Yes, the report gives an overview of the area and well written discussion of at

least 4-6 pieces of previous work, based primarily on a good reading of the

suggested work from the template

**5 points** Yes, and… the report gives and detailed and insightful analysis of the area of

study with a detailed description of very well chosen examples of previous work

that goes considerably beyond what was suggested in the template

Does the report critically evaluate the previous work and/or academic literature?

**0 points** No

**1 point** Yes, but… the report makes some attempts at evaluating previous work

**2 points** Yes, the report situates the project in a critical analysis of previous work

**3 points** Yes, and… the report gives and detailed and insightful analysis of the area of

study with a detailed description of very well chosen examples of previous work

that goes considerably beyond what was suggested in the template

Does the report contain appropriate citations?

**0 points** No

**1 point** Yes, but… the report presents some previous work without proper citations (e.g.

no citations or just links or incorrect style)

**2 points** Yes, all work mentioned in the report is cited in correct ACM style

Is the design of the project clear and of high quality?

**0 points** No

**1 point** No, but... the design is hard to follow and very incomplete, but there are some

attempts to present a design

**2 points** A design corresponding to the "acceptable" level of project described in the

template but not described in a clear or complete way, or with several flaws

**3 points** A clearly described design that corresponds the “acceptable” level of project

described in the template

**3 points** A design corresponding to the "good" or "excellent" level of project described in

the template but not described in a clear or complete way, or with several flaws

**4 points** A clearly described design (including suitable visual communication)

corresponding to the “good” level of project described in the template**4 points** A design corresponding to an “excellent” project but with elements lacking or a

few flaws

**6 points** A very clear and coherent design, described well in both visuals and writing that

corresponds to the “excellent” level of project described in the template

Is the project concept justified based on the domain and users?

**0 points** No

**1 point** No, but... there are some attempts to justify the concept, but without evidence

**2 points** Yes, but… the project concept includes some reference to the domain and users

but without a full analysis of requirements

**3 points** Yes, the project concept is based on a clear and evidenced argument for the

requirements of users and/or the domain

**4 points** Yes, and… a project concept that is strongly based on a detailed, insightful and

innovative analysis of the users and/or domain

Is the workplan explained in enough detail?

**0 points** No, there is not plan

**1 point** No, but... though there is no real plan, there is some attempt to describe when

things will be done

**2 points** Yes, but… there are elements missing or parts of the plan are vague

**3 points** Yes, this is a clearly thought out plan for implementing a project with all steps

involved and appropriate timings

Is the workplan feasible?

**0 points** No, there is no plan

**1 point** No, but... though there is no real plan, there is some attempt to describe when

things will be done

**2 points** Yes, but… the scope of the project is not feasible or appropriate. It might need to

be scaled down to ensure it is feasible, or it may need to be made more

challenging (suggestions below)

**3 points** Yes, there might be elements of the plan that are difficult or challenging, but it is

broadly feasible in terms of work proposed and timings

Is the evaluation strategy appropriate to the aims of the project?

**0 points** No, there is no evaluation strategy

**1 point** No, but... there is some attempt at an evaluation plan, but it is very confused or

not explained in any detail

**2 points** Yes, but… the strategy is simply a restatement of the suggested approach from

the template

**2 points** Yes, but… The strategy does not engage with the suggestions of the template or

is otherwise not appropriate

**3 points** Yes, it is a well thought out strategy that builds on that proposed in the template

**4 points** Yes, and… the strategy is very detailed an well thought out, going considerably

beyond that described in the template

Is the feature prototype technically challenging?

**0 points** No, the prototype is OK but fairly standard**1 point** Yes, but… This prototype includes some of the more difficult techniques or

algorithms taught in this degree

**2 points** Yes, This prototype includes some very difficult techniques or algorithms that go

beyond what is taught in this degree (closer to masters or professional level)

**3 points** Yes, and… this prototype is extremely advanced, either being close to cutting

edge research (advanced masters or PhD), or very advanced/cutting edge

professional work

Does the report successfully evaluate the feature prototype and suggest suitable

improvements if appropriate?

**0 points** No

**1 point** Yes, but… there are some attempts at evaluation, but mostly simplistic (e.g. good

vs bad) and lacking a full plan to address them

**2 points** Yes, a clear evaluation that identifies key areas for improvement and presents

ideas for improvement

**3 points** Yes, and… a very insightful analysis with an innovative plan for improvement

2. Video of Feature Prototype (4 points)

Is the feature prototype of high quality?

**0 points** No, there is no demo

**1 point** No, but, there is no working prototype, but there is some attempt at making one

**2 points** Yes, but… there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project

at the “acceptable” level of project described in the template

**2 points** Yes, but… there is a prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the

“good” or "excellent" level of project described in the template, but it has many

bugs and flaws

**3 points** Yes, there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project at the

“good” level of project described in the template

**4 points** Yes, and… there is a working prototype that would correspond to part of a project

at the “excellent” level of project described in the template
