# FocusHive: Design Document

Project Overview

FocusHive is a digital co-working and co-studying platform designed to foster shared focus

and mutual accountability among users. It aims to replicate the motivational benefits of

working or studying alongside others in a physical environment, but within a flexible, online

platform. The core concept revolves around users joining or creating virtual "hives" â€“

dedicated digital spaces where they can work on their individual tasks while being visibly

present and accountable to others in the same session.

FocusHive addresses the challenge of maintaining focus and productivity in remote work and

study environments, where the natural accountability and motivation that comes from

working alongside peers is often absent. By providing a structured virtual space for shared

work/study sessions, supported by integrated task management and optional personal focus

aids, FocusHive creates a novel solution distinct from traditional task managers, focus timers,

or general video conferencing tools.

The platform integrates key functionalities from various project templates, including identity

management, emotion-aware UI adjustments, gamification applied to group goals, music

recommendations, and data synchronization, all supporting the core mission of creating a

productive digital co-working environment.

Template Usage

FocusHive integrates components from five distinct project templates to create a cohesive

productivity ecosystem:

1. Template 7.1 - Identity and Profile Management API (Advanced Web Development)

Primary foundation for user authentication, profile management, and hive

membership control

Provides secure login/registration with OAuth2 integration

Manages user profiles storing preferences for hive interactions and focus aid

settings

Handles creation and management of private/public hives with role-based access

control

2. Template 11.2 - Emotion-Aware Adaptive Task Manager (Interaction Design)

Implemented as optional individual features within personal workspaces

Provides emotion detection using webcam/patterns to detect user states3. 4. 5. Offers adaptive interface adjustments based on detected states

Includes stress-reduction tools like breathing exercises

Template 10.2 - Gamified App (Desktop App Development)

Supports shared accountability and motivation through group-focused

gamification

Tracks collective focus streaks and hive goals/challenges

Provides accountability visualizations showing member activity

Implements desktop applications for Mac and Windows

Template 7.2 - NextTrack Music Recommendation API (Advanced Web

Development)

Offered as an optional individual feature to enhance focus

Suggests music based on user preference and task type

Integrates with music streaming services

Template 2.2 - Reconciliation Service for Dataset (Databases and Advanced Data

Techniques)

Enables real-time hive synchronization for consistent user experience

Manages database architecture for efficient storage and retrieval of hive data

Provides analytics for hive-level productivity metrics

Domain and Target Users

Domain

Cross-device synchronization for flexible work patterns

Design Choices Justification

Hive-Centered Architecture

The core "hive" concept directly addresses the primary user need for accountability and

social motivation in remote work. Unlike general video conferencing, the hive is purpose-built

for focused work with minimal distraction while maintaining awareness of others.

Justification: Research on social facilitation shows that the mere presence of others can

enhance performance on simple tasks. The hive provides this presence while avoiding the

distraction of constant interaction.Optional Camera/Presence Levels

Users can customize their level of visibility (status only, avatar, or video feed) based on

comfort and work context.

Justification: This addresses privacy concerns while still providing the accountability benefit.

It recognizes that different users have different comfort levels with visibility while working.

Real-time Presence with Minimal Interaction

The focus is on passive presence rather than active communication, with limited chat

functionality.

Justification: This design prevents the platform from becoming another source of

distraction while still providing the motivational benefits of co-presence.

Group Gamification Rather Than Individual

Achievements and streaks focus on collective hive performance rather than competitive

individual metrics.

Justification: This promotes cooperation rather than competition, creating supportive

communities. Research suggests that group commitment can be more effective than

individual goals for some users.

Optional Personal Focus Tools

Emotion-aware UI and music recommendations are implemented as opt-in personal tools

rather than core platform features.

Justification: This respects user autonomy and recognizes the highly individual nature of

focus preferences while still providing advanced tools for those who benefit from them.

Desktop Application Focus

Prioritizing desktop application development over mobile recognizes the primary use case of

focused work sessions.

Justification: Deep work typically occurs on desktop/laptop devices with larger screens and

more powerful capabilities. The desktop app supports the intended use case of dedicated

focus sessions.
