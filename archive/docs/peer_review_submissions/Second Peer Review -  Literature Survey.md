# Literature Survey: Studying Together in a Virtual Environment with FocusHive

Introduction

This literature survey reviews research and prior work relevant to the development of FocusHive, a

digital platform designed to facilitate co-studying and co-working through virtual "hives" that

promote shared focus and mutual accountability. FocusHive aims to replicate the motivational

benefits of physical study groups in an online setting, incorporating features like hive management,

gamified accountability, and real-time synchronization. By examining literature on virtual study

environments, gamification in education, and social presence in online learning, this survey identifies

effective strategies and gaps that FocusHive can address. The review includes five sources, each

evaluated for its contribution to the project and synthesized to inform FocusHive's design.

Literature Review

1. Virtual Study Groups (VSG): An Approach to Networked Collaborative Learning

Smith et al. (2020), ResearchGate

This paper introduces Virtual Study Groups (VSG) as a core component of virtual learning systems.

VSGs are formed by students with similar educational needs who collaborate to support each other's

learning and solve problems collectively. The study emphasizes VSGs' role in maintaining high

student motivation through collaborative efforts, describing them as a backup system for sustaining

engagement in virtual spaces.

Evaluation: The VSG concept aligns closely with FocusHive's hive model, where users join virtual

groups to study together. The paper highlights the motivational benefits of collaborative learning, a

primary objective of FocusHive. However, it lacks detailed empirical data on VSG effectiveness, which

limits its ability to quantify outcomes. FocusHive can build on this by incorporating measurable

accountability features, such as shared focus streaks, to enhance motivation. This source supports

the feasibility of virtual collaborative study environments but suggests a need for further empirical

validation, which FocusHive's evaluation methodology could address.2. The Promise of Using Study-Together Groups to Promote Engagement and Performance in

Online Courses

Author(s) (2023), International Journal of Higher Education

This randomized controlled trial examined the impact of study-together groups in an online chemistry

course at a public four-year college. Students offered study-together groups reported a higher sense

of belonging compared to those who were not. Additionally, students with lower academic preparation

and baseline motivation showed improved academic performance, with a 15% increase in peer study

likelihood during the intervention phase. However, highly motivated students experienced negative

effects on time management.

Evaluation: This study provides robust empirical evidence for the benefits of virtual study groups,

particularly in enhancing sense of belonging and supporting less-prepared students, aligning with

FocusHive's goal of fostering community and productivity. The finding that highly motivated students

faced time management challenges suggests a need for customizable features in FocusHive, such as

optional participation levels, to cater to diverse user needs. This source validates FocusHive's

potential to positively impact user outcomes and highlights the importance of tailoring interventions

to user profiles.

3. Gamification of E-Learning in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review

Author(s) (2023), Smart Learning Environments

This systematic review analyzes 39 empirical studies on gamification in e-learning, identifying

common game elements like points, badges, leaderboards, levels, feedback, and challenges. It notes

that only 9 studies used theoretical frameworks, such as self-determination theory, and highlights a

lack of guidelines for combining game elements effectively. Challenges and storytelling are

increasingly popular, but many studies fail to justify element selection.

Evaluation: For FocusHive, which uses gamification elements like shared focus streaks and collective

goals, this review is critical. It guides the selection of game elements and underscores the need for

theoretical grounding to ensure effectiveness. FocusHive can address the identified gap by adopting

self-determination theory to design gamification that supports intrinsic motivation. The review's

emphasis on deeper elements like challenges aligns with FocusHive's collaborative tasks, but the lack

of combination guidelines suggests an opportunity for FocusHive to innovate in integrating

gamification with virtual hives.4. Examining the Effectiveness of Gamification as a Tool Promoting Teaching and Learning in

Educational Settings: A Meta-Analysis

Author(s) (2023), Frontiers in Psychology

This meta-analysis of 41 studies reports a significant large effect size (Hedges' g = 0.822) of

gamification on student learning outcomes. Moderating factors include user type (e.g., higher

education users benefit more than secondary school learners), educational discipline (e.g., science

yields larger effects), and learning environment (offline settings outperform online). The study

suggests that combining mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics maximizes impact.

Evaluation: The meta-analysis provides strong evidence that gamification enhances learning

outcomes, supporting its inclusion in FocusHive. The finding that offline environments yield larger

effects highlights a challenge for FocusHive's online platform, suggesting a need for robust

engagement strategies like real-time feedback and social presence. FocusHive can leverage the

recommended design principles to optimize its gamified features, ensuring they are tailored to higher

education users and diverse disciplines.

5. Increasing Social Presence in Online Learning through Small Group Discussions

Akcaoglu & Lee (2016), International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning

This study compared small group (4â€“5 students) and whole class discussions in two graduate-level

online courses. Small groups significantly increased perceptions of social presence, with higher

scores for sociability (d = 0.61), social space (d = 0.56), and group cohesion (d = 0.61). Students

reported deeper engagement in small groups but noted challenges with timely participation.

Evaluation: Social presence is vital for FocusHive's hive concept, where users interact in small

groups to foster community. This study supports the design choice of small, permanent hives,

demonstrating their ability to enhance connection and engagement. The challenge of timely

participation suggests FocusHive should include features like status indicators and reminders to

maintain group dynamics. This source underscores the importance of social presence in virtual study

environments and informs FocusHive's user experience design.

Synthesis

The reviewed literature provides a strong foundation for FocusHive's design. Virtual study groups, as

explored by Smith et al. (2020) and the 2023 RCT, enhance motivation, sense of belonging, and

academic performance, particularly for students with lower preparation. Gamification, as evidenced

by the 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis, significantly improves learning outcomes when

designed with theoretical rigor and appropriate elements. Small group interactions, as shown by

Akcaoglu and Lee (2016), foster social presence, crucial for maintaining engagement in virtual

environments.

Despite these insights, a notable gap exists in the literature: few studies explore the integration of

gamification with virtual study groups. While individual components are well-researched, platforms

combining both, like FocusHive, are underexplored. FocusHive addresses this by merging

collaborative hives with gamified accountability features, such as shared goals and streaks, to create

a novel solution. The literature also highlights challenges, such as the need for theoretical grounding

in gamification and timely participation in small groups, which FocusHive can tackle through self-

determination theory and real-time synchronization features.

Conclusion

This literature survey synthesizes research on virtual study groups, gamification, and social presence

to guide the development of FocusHive. The findings confirm the efficacy of collaborative learning

environments, gamified strategies, and small group interactions in enhancing motivation,

engagement, and community. By addressing the gap in integrated platforms and incorporating

theoretical frameworks, FocusHive can offer a unique and effective solution for virtual co-studying.

Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of such integrated platforms and explore optimal

feature combinations for diverse user groups.
