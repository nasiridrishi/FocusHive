## Timeline Considerations

Given the project timeline (May 22 - September 15, 2025), this preliminary report likely falls in Phase 2 of development. The prototype should:
- Be achievable within 2-3 weeks of development
- Demonstrate core technical competencies
- Provide insights for full implementation
- Allow time for evaluation and documentation

## Tips for Success

1. **Choose a prototype that**:
   - Represents a core feature of FocusHive
   - Is technically challenging but achievable
   - Can be evaluated meaningfully
   - Provides learning for the full project

2. **For the evaluation**:
   - Use appropriate metrics for your chosen feature
   - Consider both technical and user experience aspects
   - Be honest about limitations
   - Link evaluation methods to academic literature

3. **For the video**:
   - Plan your demonstration script
   - Show the feature in action
   - Explain technical decisions
   - Keep within the 3-5 minute limit

## Next Steps

1. Review existing peer review submissions for chapters 2 and 3
2. Select the most appropriate feature for prototyping
3. Develop a detailed implementation plan
4. Begin prototype development
5. Plan evaluation methodology
6. Prepare video demonstration script
